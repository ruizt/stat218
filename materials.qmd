Refer to this page for a detailed schedule of coursework and links to all materials. This information is organized by week, and you should check this page on a weekly basis for updates as the quarter progresses.

I will aim to post/update outlines for class meetings at the beginning of each week (Monday), and update with links to relevant materials as the week progresses. So, you should look at the beginning of the week to see what's ahead, and check back for newly posted materials before and after class meetings.

### Preparing for class meetings

-   Complete readings *in advance* of the class meetings for which they are listed. Take notes or make annotations, and bring your notes to class.
-   Download and/or print copies of posted slides and handouts and bring these to class.
-   If a lab is indicated, it is recommended that you bring your laptop/tablet. While these are group activities and it is an option to share, you will not have direct access to your groupmates' work after the class meeting.
