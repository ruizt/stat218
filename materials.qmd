Refer to this page for a detailed schedule of coursework and links to all materials. This information is organized by week, and you should check this page on a weekly basis for updates as the quarter progresses. 

I will aim to post an outline for class meetings at the beginning of each week (Monday), and update with links to relevant materials as the week progresses. So, you should look at the beginning of the week to see what's ahead, and check back for newly posted materials before and after class meetings.

If you have any difficulty accessing materials or understanding the organization of the page, please let me know.

### General guidelines

- Readings should be completed *in advance* of the class meetings for which they are listed; we will have in-class reading quizzes.
- If links to slides or handouts are available prior to class meetings, it is recommended (but not required) that you download and/or print copies and bring them to class for annotation.
- You will be expected to make copies of
