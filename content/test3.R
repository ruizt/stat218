## ----setup, echo = F--------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)
library(emmeans)


## ----problem 1 famuss, include = F------------------------------------------

# part a: plot change in nondominant arm strength by genotype

# part b: fit ANOVA model and construct table

# part c: if ANOVA indicates differences by genotype, test for pairwise differences and provide interval estimates for any significant differences

# part d: check whether conclusions from the analysis are the same if inference is instead on mean change in dominant arm strength



## ----problem 2 meadowfoam, include = F--------------------------------------
## NOTE: there is no data associated with this problem

# part a: calculations for ANOVA table (MS, F, p)



## problem 3 grazers ----include = F------------------------------------------
# load and inspect data

# part a: construct boxplots and check assumptions

# part b: how many replicates (plots) per group?

# part c: fit anova model and generate table

# part d: test contrasts to determine which grazers affect regeneration at 1% level

# part e: estimate effect of grazers with significant impacts at 1% level


## extra credit logging ----include = F---------------------------------------
# load and inspect data

# make a plot to compare logged and unlogged areas

# part a: nonparametric test to compare percent loss between area types
