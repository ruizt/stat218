Statistics plays a crucial role in the sciences: statistical techniques provide a means of weighing quantitative evidence derived from observation and experimentation in the face of uncertainty. Statistical thinking and data analysis also facilitate discovery, exploration, and hypothesis generation. This class aims to introduce students to common statistical methods used almost universally across the sciences — descriptive and graphical techniques, inferential methods for comparing population means, analysis of categorical data and contingency tables, and linear regression — while drawing on examples from the life sciences to help illuminate the potential for application in students' chosen field(s) of study.

Activities and assignments will be distributed via this workspace. Please be aware that any files you create on the workspace will be visible to admins.

**Course notes**: notes to supplement readings will be posted as needed on the course website.

### Learning outcomes

The course aims to enable you to demonstrate the following abilities.

-   \[L1\] design a data collection scheme based on simple random sampling or simple experimental designs

-   \[L2\] distinguish between observational studies and experiments and understand the limitations (practical and consequential) of each

-   \[L3\] summarize data using graphical and numerical techniques

-   \[L4\] construct and interpret confidence intervals for means and differences between means for independent and paired samples

-   \[L5\] conduct parametric and non-parametric two-sample hypothesis tests for means

-   \[L6\] construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single proportion

-   \[L7\] conduct Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and tests for independence

-   \[L8\] distinguish between case-control and cohort studies and compute relative-risk and odds in the appropriate settings

-   \[L9\] perform analysis of variance tests and post-hoc comparisons for completely randomized designs

-   \[L10\] use simple linear regression to describe relationships between variables

In addition, you will learn to perform simple analyses and computations in R and can expect to attain a basic level of proficiency with the software; however, as this is not a programming class, emphasis will be placed on obtaining and interpreting relevant outputs in the context of the analyses indicated above.

### Assessments

Attainment of learning outcomes will be measured by performance on homework assignments, tests, and a comprehensive final exam.

**Homeworks** are your opportunity to practice using course concepts and methods covered in class and comprise both graded and ungraded questions, marked as such. Graded questions will be largely data analytic and will correspond to specific marked learning outcomes; responses will be assessed as satisfactory (S) or needing improvement (NI) according to whether they are fully correct, and qualitative feedback will be offered if an assessment of NI is given. Ungraded questions are entirely for your benefit as extra practice. You can submit revisions to any graded responses needing improvement for reassessment.

**Tests** are your opportunity to demonstrate that you've synthesized course material and achieved learning outcomes. Tests will comprise sets of questions, some conceptual and some data analytic, corresponding to specific marked learning outcomes. Responses will be assessed as satisfactory (S) or needing improvement (NI) according to whether they are fully correct, and qualitative feedback will be offered if an assessment of NI is given. You will be given a 24 hour window to complete each test, and afforded an opportunity to submit revisions to responses needing improvement.

The **final exam** will be a comprehensive assessment focusing on concepts and interpretation of data analytic results. No use of R will be required for the final exam. Questions will correspond to specific marked learning outcomes, and responses will be assessed as satisfactory (S) or unsatisfactory (U). Due to the timing of the final exam, no revisions will be allowed. Final exams, per University policy, will be retained, but can be reviewed on request after the term has concluded.

**Letter grades** will be determined as follows. Students will receive a score for each learning outcome representing the weighted proportion of questions matched with that outcome that received a satisfactory assessment across all assignments, with relatively more weight given to questions from tests. The outcome will be determined as 'fully met' if the weighted proportion is at least 0.8, 'partly met' if the weighted proportion is between 0.5 and 0.8, and 'unmet' otherwise. To receive a passing grade in the class, at least five outcomes must be fully met, and one more must be partly met. Letter grades are then defined as follows:

| Grade | Minimum number of fully met outcomes | Minimum number of partly met outcomes |
|-------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| A     | 9                                    | 1                                     |
| A-    | 9                                    | 0                                     |
| B+    | 8                                    | 2                                     |
| B     | 8                                    | 1                                     |
| B-    | 8                                    | 0                                     |
| C+    | 7                                    | 2                                     |
| C     | 7                                    | 1                                     |
| C-    | 7                                    | 0                                     |
| D+    | 6                                    | 2                                     |
| D     | 6                                    | 1                                     |
| D-    | 6                                    | 0                                     |

Please note that these definitions are tentative and potentially subject to change. Please also note that failure to adhere to course policies — particularly collaboration, academic integrity, and attendance policies — may result in a lower letter grade than would otherwise be assigned.

### Course policies

#### Collaboration

Collaboration within the class and across class sections is allowed and encouraged on homework assignments, subject to certain conditions outlined in the paragraph below. Collaborations should not include individuals outside of the class. Students collaborating with a group are expected to prepare their own assignment submissions, in their own words and writing, and should to indicate their collaborators in writing on their submission. This is limited to peers that were consulted closely in completing the assignment; brief or passing interactions are not considered collaborations.

A collaboration is a shared effort. Students that choose to work together on homework assignments are expected to make material contributions towards producing one or more shared answers or solutions. Material contributions might include participation in discussions, critique of a proposed solution, or presentation of a problem approach. In the absence of such contributions, submitting solutions prepared in a group is not appropriate. The best way to adhere to this policy is to attempt problems individually before consulting others and exchanging work.

#### Attendance

Regular attendance is essential for success in the course and required per University policy. Each student may miss two class meetings without notice but additional absences should be [excusable](https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/class-attendance) and students should notify the instructor. Unexcused absences may negatively impact course grades.

#### Communication and email

Students are encouraged to use face-to-face means of communication (office hours, class meetings, appointments) when possible. Email may be used on a secondary basis or when a written record of communication is needed. Every effort is made to respond to email within 48 weekday hours — so a message sent Thursday or Friday may not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday. Time-sensitive messages should be identified as such in the subject line. Students should wait one week before sending a reminder.

#### Time commitment

STAT218 is a four-credit course, which corresponds to a minimum time commitment of 12 hours per week, including lectures, reading, assignments, and study time. Some variability in workload by week should be expected, and most students will need to budget a few extra hours each week. However, students can expect to be able to meet course expectations with a time commitment of 12-16 hours per week. Considering that lecture accounts for four hours per week, students should anticipate devoting 8-12 hours outside of class.

#### Assignment scores and final grades

Every effort will be made to provide consistent, fair, and accurate evaluation of student work. Students should notify the instructor of any suspected errors or discrepancies in evaluation promptly on an assignment-by-assignment basis (*i.e.,* not at the end of the quarter) to guarantee consideration. Final (letter) grades will only be changed in the case of clerical errors. Attempting to negotiate scores or final grades is not appropriate.

Per University policy, faculty have final responsibility for grading criteria and grading judgment and have the right to alter student assessment or other parts of the syllabus during the term. If any student feels their grade is unfairly assigned at the end of the course, they have the right to appeal it according to the procedure outlined [here](https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academic-petition-appeals).

#### Deadlines and late work

Each student may turn in two homework assignments up to one week late without penalty at any time during the quarter and without notice. Subsequently, assignments turned in up to one week late will be evaluated for 75% credit unless an extension is granted in advance. As a general policy, late work will be not accepted beyond one week after the original due date. Deadlines for tests are strict.

These policies are intended to provide you with some flexibility to work around unforeseen circumstances while maintaining accountability for completing coursework in a timely manner. That said, if any circumstances arise that the policies do not accommodate well, please let me know and I will do my best to work with you to keep you on track in the course. Exceptions may be granted for significant and unforeseen challenges (medical absences, family emergencies, and the like).

#### Accommodations

It is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Accommodation requests should be made through the [Disability Resource Center](https://drc.calpoly.edu) (DRC).

#### Conduct and Academic Integrity

Students are expected to be aware of and adhere to University policy regarding academic integrity and conduct. Detailed information on these policies, and potential repercussions of policy violations, can be found via the [Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities](https://osrr.calpoly.edu) (OSRR).

Instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to OSRR and will result in penalty ranging from credit reduction to grade reduction to course failure, depending on the severity of the situation.

#### Copyright and distribution of course materials

All course materials, including handouts, homework assignments, lab assignments, study guides, course notes, exams, and solutions are subject to copyright; students are not permitted to share or distribute any course materials without the written consent of the instructor. This includes, in particular, uploading materials or prepared solutions to online services and sharing materials or prepared solutions with students who may take the course in a future term. Transgressions of this policy compromise the effectiveness of instruction and assessment and do a disservice to current and future students.
