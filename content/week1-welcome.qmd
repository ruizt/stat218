## About me

Hi I'm Trevor. You can call me Trevor, or, if you prefer, Dr. Ruiz.

-   Born in Oregon, grew up in Maryland
-   BA Philosophy, MS & PhD Statistics
-   Research interests: methods for large and complex scientific data
-   Hobbies: juggling, dance, classical guitar
-   Have a cat

## Why am I a statistician?

Short answer: I like variety.

Long answer:

-   as a philosophy student I was interested in how we support claims of empirical fact through scientific investigation

-   usually involves data as quantitative evidence

-   statistics is the science of evaluating quantitative evidence

Silly answer: I couldn't come up with anything better to do.

## About you

By the numbers...

```{r class info}
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 16))
roster <- read_csv('data/roster-anonymous.csv')

fig1 <- roster %>% 
  mutate(standing = factor(standing, 
                           levels = c('Freshman', 
                                      'Sophomore', 
                                      'Junior', 
                                      'Senior'))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = standing)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = 'Class standing', y = 'Number of students')

fig2 <- roster %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_rev(fct_infreq(major)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(y = 'Major', x = 'Number of students') +
  scale_x_sqrt(breaks = c(1, 2, 5, 10, 15))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(fig1, fig2, nrow = 1)
```

## Warm up: uncertainty {.smaller}

Life is full of uncertainty, and this can make a lot of questions hard to answer:

1.  Imagine you're a medical care provider. Which therapy should you prescribe for a patient given their prognosis? You don't know precisely how each one will turn out, so how do you decide?
2.  Flu shots don't always prevent people from getting the flu; many people who are innoculated still become ill, sometimes fatally. Your doctor asks if you want the shot. Should you get it?
3.  You're a trainer devising a fitness regimen for a client. You've decided on the basic elements, but what order should you recommend? Will it make any difference with respect to their goals? How will you know?
4.  You're considering trying a nutritional supplement for weight loss. Some people that try it experience severe side effects, but not too many. So, is it safe? It works sometimes, but not all the time. So, is it effective?

## Statistics and uncertainty

*Key problem: similar situations do not always result in the same outcome.*

Statistical thinking: **uncertainty is measurable**.

What statistics can offer:

-   principles for designing studies and collecting data in order to capture outcome variability
-   data analytic tools to distinguish random from systematic variability
-   heuristics to make inferences that account for uncertainty

## Course goal and scope

The overarching goal of 218 is to introduce you to statistics in a hands-on way that is relevant to your major.

So we will focus on:

-   statistical thinking, study design, and data analysis
-   classical methods, mostly developed 1900-1940
-   case studies from life sciences
-   application, not theory

## Materials {.smaller}

**Web**. All materials are hosted/linked on the course website. I *won't* be using Canvas.

**Books**. Readings will be assigned from three textbooks, all available at no cost:

-   Vu and Harrington (2020). [Introdutory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences](https://www.openintro.org/book/biostat/).
-   Van Belle, Fisher, Heagerty, and Lumley (2004). [Biostatistics: a methodology for the health sciences](https://csu-calpoly.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CALS_PSU/1qh1nk7/alma991005991838302920).
-   Douglas *et al.* (2023). [An Introduction to R](https://intro2r.com).

**Computing**. Hosted online via posit.cloud; more details in a bit.

**Other.** You'll need a laptop, tablet with keyboard, or access to a computer. MS Word strongly recommended but not strictly necessary.

## Patterns {.smaller}

Class meeting pattern:

-   reading quiz (not for credit)
-   short lecture, with discussion
-   5min break
-   lab activity in groups
-   case study presentation, with discussion

Weekly pattern:

-   class meeting agendas updated Mondays

## Assessments {.smaller}

On the syllabus, you'll find 11 learning outcomes labelled \[L1\] — \[L11\].

-   Graded questions on the homeworks are matched to these outcomes.

-   Test questions are also matched to outcomes.

Graded questions receive a binary assessment.

-   \(S\) satisfactory: outcome attained

-   (NI) needs improvement: outcome not yet attained

You can submit revisions to any assignment or test for reassessment at least once.

-   Timelines and number of attempts differ by assignment type (homework or test).

## Final oral exam

You'll be responsible for identifying a case study in your field of study that uses methods from the class:

-   in pairs, otherwise private

-   5min presentation

-   short Q&A

-   scheduled during final exam period

Your assessment for this will pertain only to \[L11\]: applying methods from the course to your major field of study.

## Grades

At the end of the quarter, you will receive for each outcome L1 — L11:

-   a **score**: proportion of questions outcome that received a satisfactory assessment

-   an **evaluation**: whether that outcome was fully met, partly met, or not met

    -   not met: under 50%

    -   partly met: 50% — 80%

    -   fully met: 80% or better

Your letter grade will be based on the tally of fully met and partly met outcomes.

## Letter grades

Details are in the syllabus, but:

-   Must at partly or fully meet at least...
    -   6/11 to pass
    -   8/11 for B or better
    -   10/11 for A or better
-   Subject to those thresholds, letter grade is determined by the number of outcomes fully met

## Grading example {.smaller .scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="0.7"}
| Learning outcome | Score | Evaluation |

| L3               | 100%  | Fully met  |
| L4               | 64%   | Partly met |
| L6               | 86%   | Fully met  |
| L7               | 91%   | Fully met  |
| L8               | 89%   | Fully met  |
| L9               | 57%   | Partly met |
| L10              | 41%   | Not met    |
| L11              | 100%  | Fully met  |

Your grade might look something like this:

\[10 partly or fully met\] + \[7 fully met\] ➞ B+
:::
:::

## Select policies

-   collaboration encouraged on homeworks; not allowed on tests

-   attendance expected; more than two unexcused absences may negatively impact grade

-   expect to allocate 12-16hr/wk, including class meetings

-   two free late assignment submissions, anytime and without notice, up to one week from deadline

## Office hours & email

Office hours are 12-2 M-W

-   Schedule 10min time slots via Calendly

Usually I get to email quickly, but allow at least 48 (weekday) hours

-   If you haven't heard back in a week, that means I missed it — send me a reminder!

## Working groups

For labs and in class activities, you'll work in groups. Let's form those now.

Icebreakers:

-   Name, major, class standing

-   Hometown

-   One personal interest

## Introduction to posit.cloud

You'll be learning some basics in R in this class. It's not a programming class, so the goal is to learn simply to implement the methods we're covering.

Why R?

-   Free

-   Open source — rapid development for new methods

-   Widely used

Let's take some time to introduce this environment.

Go to: course webpage \> syllabus \> materials. Then look for:

![](img/posit-link.png){fig-align="center"}

Take a moment to create an account.

## An example project

![](img/posit-landing.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Make sure the class workspace "stat218" is highlighted at left. If "Your Workspace" is highlighted, you won't see the example assignment.

<!-- -->

2.  Click on the example assignment, then wait.

Once everyone is ready, we'll have a look at the example files together.

## Orientation checklist

1.  Overall layout of RStudio: file navigator, console, file editor.
2.  `README.md` — keep this open for reference as we go.
    -   As an aside: whenever you see a file called README, you should read it.
3.  `example-script.R` is an R script
    -   how to execute lines of code
    -   data import on L18
    -   make and save changes
4.  `example-doc.qmd` is a quarto doc
    -   YAML header
    -   how to render
    -   make and save changes
5.  Files you should ignore

## General pointers

-   don't change the directory structure

-   don't rename, add, or remove files

-   anything you create will be visible to me

-   any changes you make on assignments *won't* be shareable with your classmates

## For next time

You'll read about study designs.

As you're reading, consider this example: there is broad agreement that smoking causes cancer. Try and answer these questions:

1.  Not all smokers develop cancer, so smoking doesn't cause cancer in the way that combustion causes a flame. What then do we mean by "cause" when we say that smoking causes cancer?
2.  How would you design a study to test the hypothesis that smoking causes cancer?
    -   Which of the study designs in your reading are *applicable*?
    -   Among applicable designs, which are *possible*?
    -   Among the possible designs, which are practically and ethically *feasible*?
    -   Among feasible designs, which would you choose and what would you measure?
