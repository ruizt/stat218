# Course logistics

## Icebreakers

By show of hands...

::: incremental
1.  First statistics class ever?
2.  Last statistics class ever?
3.  Expect to take STAT313?
4.  Expect to use statistics for your degree coursework or senior project?
5.  Considering a statistics or data science minor?
:::

## Class composition

By the numbers...

```{r class info}
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 16))
roster <- read_csv('data/roster-anonymous.csv')

fig1 <- roster %>% 
  mutate(standing = factor(standing, 
                           levels = c('Freshman', 
                                      'Sophomore', 
                                      'Junior', 
                                      'Senior'))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = standing)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = 'Class standing', y = 'Number of students')

fig2 <- roster %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_rev(fct_infreq(major)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(y = 'Major', x = 'Number of students') +
  scale_x_sqrt(breaks = c(1, 2, 5, 10, 15))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(fig1, fig2, nrow = 1)
```

## Statistics and uncertainty

> Life is full of uncertainty, and this can make a lot of questions hard to answer, because similar situations do not always result in the same outcome.

Statistical thinking: **uncertainty is measurable**.

What statistics can offer:

-   principles for designing studies and collecting data in order to capture outcome variability
-   data analytic tools to distinguish random from systematic variability
-   heuristics to make inferences that account for uncertainty

## Course goal and scope

The overarching goal of 218 is to introduce you to statistics in a hands-on way that is relevant to your major.

So we will focus on:

-   statistical thinking, study design, and data analysis
-   classical methods, mostly developed 1900-1940
-   case studies from life sciences

## Materials

**Computer/tablet.** You'll need a laptop (preferred) or tablet with keyboard (workable).

**Course website**. All materials are hosted/linked on the course website. I *won't* be using Canvas.

**Textbook**. Vu and Harrington (2020). [Introdutory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences](https://www.openintro.org/book/biostat/). I suggest a $5-15 donation.

**Statistical software**. R/RStudio hosted online via posit.cloud workspace. You will need to create an account and purchase a $5/month student subscription.

## Class meetings

Class meetings will usually consist of a reading quiz, a lecture, a break, and a lab.

**Preparing for class meetings:**

1.   Check the course website for posted reading, materials, and assignments.
2.   Complete readings *in advance* of the class meetings for which they are listed. 
3. Write down one question you have about the reading and bring it to class.
4.   Download and/or print a copy of the posted course notes (slides) for you to annotate and bring them to class.

## Assignments

You will have three categories of assignments:

- **homework** problems: two per class due by next class
- **tests**: every 2-3 weeks, distributed Wednesday, due Friday
- a **project**: find and present a case study

Deadline policies:

- one-hour grace period on all deadlines
- four homework problem sets can be turned in up to 48 hours late without notice
- besides free lates, extensions must be arranged 24 hours in advance of the deadline

## Grades

Every graded question/problem is matched to one or more of the 11 course learning outcomes.

- Questions/problems are evaluated as satisfactory (S), needs improvement (NI), or missing (M).

- For each outcome, the percentage of questions/problems awarded a satisfactory mark is used to determine whether that outcome is fully met, partly met, or not met:

    + fully met: 80% or more of matched questions satisfactory
    + partly met: 50% -- 80% of matched questions satisfactory
    + not met: less than 50% of matched questions satisfactory

Your course grade is based on how many learning outcomes are fully met. To pass, you must partly or fully meet at least 6 outcomes; for a C-, you must fully meet at least 3 outcomes.

## Important policies

- extensions must be confirmed (not simply requested) 24 hours in advance
- collaboration on homework is encouraged, but everyone involved needs to...
  
    + make a contribution
    + write up their own work
    
- submitting AI-generated content in place of your own work is not acceptable

    + responsible use is okay, but not recommended (GPT outputs are misleading)
    + penalties for AI plagiarism depend on precedent and severity

 Minor offense | Major offense | Penalty
---|---|---
First |  | loss of credit and warning
Second | First | loss of credit and OSRR report
Third | Second | course failure and second OSRR report

# Study design

## What is a study?

A **study** is an effort to collect data in order to answer one or more research questions.

-   studies must be well-matched to research questions to provide good answers

-   how data are obtained is just as important as how the resulting data are analyzed

-   no analysis, no matter how sophisticated will rescue a poorly conceived study

A **study unit** is the smallest object or entity that is measured in a study; also called *experimental unit* or *observational unit.*

## Two types of studies

**Observational studies** collect data from an existing situation without intervention.

-   Aim is to detect associations and patterns

-   Can't be used to establish causal links

**Experiments** collect data from a situation in which one or more interventions have been introduced by the investigator.

-   Aim is to draw conclusions about the causal effect of interventions
-   Stronger form of scientific evidence than an observational study

Often, observational studies are used to explore/generate hypotheses prior to designing an experiment.

## Comparing study types

Either type of study can be used to address a question.

| Question                                          | Observational study                                                      | Experiment                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Are diet and mood related?                        | Conduct surveys on diet, lifestyle, and affect                           | Recruit study participants, assign diets, measure affect                                     |
| Is vaping safer than smoking?                     | Follow groups of vapers and smokers over time and record health outcomes | Among a group of smokers, assign some to switch to vaping; compare health outcomes over time |
| Do insecticide applications affect soil microbes? | Analyze soil samples from farms using different insecticides             | \[**Your turn**\]                                                                            |

Can you think of pros and cons for each study type?

## Why does intervention matter?

Control over conditions allows a researcher to study causal effects resulting from interventions. This is not possible in observational studies due to the potential for **confounding**.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Confounding: an unobserved condition is associated with both the study condition and the outcome.

- Failure to measure and account for confounders potentially distorts observed associations
- Example: a study finds that dog owners live longer, but doesn't measure exercise; so it might just be the daily walks.

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  A(unobserved variable) --- B(study variable) & C(study outcome) 
```
:::
:::

This is very common in observational studies, because you can't measure every study condition.

## Antidote: randomization

The ability to control study conditions allows researchers to randomly allocate interventions among study subjects.

::: columns
**Randomization eliminates confounding** by isolating the condition(s) of interest:

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   interventions are independent of extraneous conditions ‚üπ no association possible

-   if outcomes differ systematically according to the intervention, you can be certain that it is not an artifact
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  A(unobserved condition) x-.-x B(study condition)
  A --- C(outcome)
```
:::
:::

## Practical consequences

The ability to randomize interventions in experiments means:

-   observed associations are independent of extraneous factors

-   results can support causal inferences

The absence of randomization in observational studies means:

-   confounding is always possible

-   results may be misleading

## Experimental designs

A **treatment** is an experimental intervention; the **design** of an experiment refers to how treatments are allocated to study units.

The most basic design is:

-   \[balanced\] each treatment is replicated an equal number of times

-   \[randomized\] treatments are allocated completely at random to study units

-   \[no crossover\] each study unit receives exactly one treatment

We'll call this a **completely randomized design**. It's the only kind of experimental design we're going to consider in STAT218.

There are many other designs that we won't discuss (but see STAT313); these are all about improving experimental efficiency by controlling extraneous variation.

## Data collection

Study units should be chosen so as to represent a larger collection.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/srs.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
A study **population** is a collection of all study units of interest.

A **sample** is a subcollection from a population:

-   *random* if study units have a known chance of inclusion in the sample
-   *nonrandom* or *convenience* otherwise
:::
:::

The gold standard is the **simple random sample**: each study unit in the population has an equal chance of inclusion in the sample.

## LEAP Study

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
Learning early about peanut allergy (LEAP) study:

-   640 infants in UK with eczema or egg allergy but no peanut allergy enrolled

-   each infant randomly assigned to peanut consumption and peanut avoidance groups

    -   peanut consumption: fed 6g peanut protein daily until 5 years old

    -   peanut avoidance: no peanut consumption until 5 years old

-   at 5 years old, oral food challenge (OFC) allergy test administered

-   13.3% of the avoidance group developed allergies, compared with 1.9% of the consumption group
