## Today's agenda

1.  Reading quiz
2.  [lecture] data semantics and data types
3.  [lab] R basics


## Data semantics

-   **Data** are a set of measurements.

-   A **variable** is any measured attribute of study units.

-   An **observation** is a measurement of one or more variables taken on one particular study unit.

It is usually expedient to arrange data values in a table in which each row is an observation and each column is a variable:

![](img/data-matrix.png)

## LEAP example

A table showing the observations and variables for the LEAP study would look like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(oibiostat)
library(pander)
data(LEAP)
LEAP %>% 
  select(participant.ID, treatment.group, overall.V60.outcome) %>%
  rename(ofc.test.result = overall.V60.outcome) %>%
  head(4) %>%
  pander()
```

The table you saw in the reading was a **summary** of the data (not the data itself):

```{r}
LEAP %>%
  rename(ofc.test.result = overall.V60.outcome) %>%
  select(treatment.group, ofc.test.result) %>%
  table() %>%
  pander()
```

## Numeric and categorical variables

Variables are classified according to their values. Values can be one of two different types:

-   A variable is **numeric** if its value is a number
-   A variable is **categorical** if its value is a category, usually recorded as a name or label

For example:

-   the value of `sex` can be male or female, so it is categorical
-   whereas `age` (in years) can be any positive integer, so it is numeric

<!-- *Check your understanding: in the LEAP study...* -->

<!-- -   *treatment group is \[numeric/categorical\]* -->
<!-- -   *OFC test result is \[numeric/categorical\]* -->

## Variable subtypes

Further distinctions are made based on the type of number or type of category used to measure an attribute. *Can you match the subtypes to the variables at right?*

::: columns
::: {.column width="0.65"}
![](img/variable-types.png)
:::

::: {.column width="0.35"}
```{r, echo = F}
set.seed(11824)
data(yrbss)
yrbss %>%
  select(age, hispanic, grade, weight) %>%
  sample_n(size = 4) %>%
  pander::pander()
```
:::
:::

-   a numerical variable is **discrete** if there are 'gaps' between its *possible* values
-   a numerical variable is **continuous** if there are no such gaps
-   a categorical variable is **nominal** if its levels are not ordered
-   a categorical variable is **ordinal** if its levels are ordered

## Many ways to measure attributes

Variable type (or subtype) is not an inherent quality --- attributes can often be measured in many different ways.

For instance, `age` might be measured as either a discrete, continuous, or ordinal variable, depending on the situation:

| Age (years) | Age (minutes) | Age (brackets) |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 12          | 6307518.45    | 10-18          |
| 8           | 4209187.18    | 5-10           |
| 21          | 11258103.08   | 18-30          |

> Numeric variables can always be represented as categorical, *but not the other way around*.

## Your turn

Classify each variable as nominal, ordinal, discrete, or continuous:

```{r}
load('data/famuss.RData')
set.seed(11324)
famuss %>% 
  sample_n(size = 4) %>% 
  select(ndrm.ch, genotype, sex, age, race, bmi) |>
  pander()
```

Data are from an observational study investigating demographic, physiological, and genetic characteristics associated with muscle strength.

-   `ndrm.ch` is change in strength in nondominant arm after resistance training
-   `genotype` indicates genotype at a particular location within the ACTN3 gene

## Common summary statistics

> A **statistic** is a data summary: in mathematical terms, a function of several observations

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
For numeric variables, the most common summary statistic is the **average value**:

$$\text{average} = \frac{\text{sum of values}}{\text{# observations}}$$

For example, the average percent change in nondominant arm strength was `r famuss$ndrm.ch |> mean() |> round(3)`%.
:::

::: {.column}
For categorical variables, the most common summary statistic is a **proportion**:

$$\text{proportion}_i = \frac{\text{# observations in category } i}{\text{# observations}}$$

For example:

```{r}
famuss$genotype |> 
  table() |> 
  proportions() |> 
  pander(caption = 'Genotype proportions')
```


:::

## Descriptive analyses

Sometimes, a few clever summary statistics can be used to answer a research question.

> How much does the average change in arm strength differ by genotype, if at all?

Computing *per-genotype* averages provides an answer:

```{r}
famuss |>
  group_by(genotype) |>
  summarize(avg.change = mean(ndrm.ch),
            n.obs = n()) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(prop.obs = n.obs/sum(n.obs)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg.change)) |>
  pander()
```

Number of observations and proportions are included because they provide information about genotype frequencies in the sample.

- conveys how many individuals were measured
- also provides an estimate of genotype frequencies in the population

## Common mathematical notation

While we won't use mathematical expressions too often in STAT218, it's useful to be aware of some common notations.

Typically, a set of observations is written as:

$$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$$

- $x$ represents the variable (*e.g.*, genotype, age, percent change, etc.)
- subscript indexes observations: $x_i$ is the $i$th observation
- $n$ is the total **n**umber of observations

The sum of the observations is written $\sum_i x_i$, where the symbol $\sum$ stands for 'summation'. This is useful for writing the formula for computing an average:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i x_i$$

## Lab: data basics in R

The variable types we just discussed map pretty neatly (but not perfectly) onto the main "data types" in R:

-   numeric ➜ integer, numeric
-   categorical ➜ character, factor, logical

The primary way data are arranged in R is in a **data frame**. This lab will show you how to load, inspect, and use data frames.

Your objectives in this lab are: 

1. learn to load and inspect datasets
2. learn to recognize data types
3. learn to perform simple calculations (averages, etc.)

## Opening the lab activity

Navigate to posit.cloud. Then:

![](img/posit-landing.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Make sure the class workspace "stat218-s24" is highlighted at left. If "Your Workspace" is highlighted, you won't see the example assignment.

2.  Click on the `lab1-rbasics`, then wait.

Once everyone is ready, we'll have a look at the example files together.
