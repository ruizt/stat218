## Today's agenda

1. Reading quiz
2. Loose end: robustness
3. Bivariate numeric and graphical summaries
4. Lab: bivariate graphics in R

## Robustness

> Percentile-based measures of location and spread are less sensitive to outliers

Consider adding an observation of 94 to our 12 ages from last time. This is an outlier.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r, echo = T}
# append an outlier
ages_add <- c(ages, 94)

# means
c(original = mean(ages), with.outlier = mean(ages_add))

# medians
c(original = median(ages), with.outlier = median(ages_add))

# IQR
c(original = IQR(ages), with.outlier = IQR(ages_add))

# SD
c(original = sd(ages), with.outlier = sd(ages_add))
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
The effect of this outlier on each statistic is:

- mean increases by `r round(100*(mean(ages_add) - mean(ages))/mean(ages), 2)`%
- median increases by `r round(100*(median(ages_add) - median(ages))/median(ages), 2)`%
- IQR increases by `r round(100*(IQR(ages_add) - IQR(ages))/IQR(ages), 2)`%
- SD increases by `r round(100*(sd(ages_add) - sd(ages))/sd(ages), 2)`%

**Robustness** refers to sensitivity to outliers. Mean and SD are less robust than median and IQR.

:::

## Choosing appropriate measures

> When outliers are present, use percentile-based measures; otherwise, use mean and standard deviation or variance

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=2.5}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1),
    cex = 1.5,
    mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(census$total_personal_income, 
     main = '', xlab = 'total personal income', ylab = 'frequency')
hist(census$age, 
     main = '', xlab = 'age', ylab = 'frequency')
```

*Check your understanding: which measures are most appropriate for each variable above?*

## Limitations of univariate summaries

> Univariate summaries aim to capture the distribution of values of a single variable.

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height = 4}
library(oibiostat)
data(famuss)
height <- famuss$height
weight <- famuss$weight

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
par(mar = c(5, 5, 3, 1),
    cex.main = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 1.5)
hist(height)
abline(v = mean(height), col = 2, lwd = 2)
hist(weight)
abline(v = mean(weight), col = 2, lwd = 2)
```
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
-   both unimodal, no obvious outliers
-   heights symmetric
-   weights right-skewed
-   but these observations actually come in *pairs*
:::
:::

Univariate summaries don't reflect how the variables might be related.

## Bivariate summaries

> Bivariate summaries aim to capture a relationship between two variables.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
A simple example is a scatterplot:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(5, 5, 1, 1),
    cex.main = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 1.5)
plot(height, weight)
points(mean(height), mean(weight), col = 2, pch = 17, cex = 2)
abline(v = mean(height), h = mean(weight), col = 2, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
Each point represents a pair of values $(h, w)$ for one study participant.

-   Reveals a relationship: taller participants tend to be heavier
-   But no longer shows individual distributions clearly

Notice, though, that the marginal means (dashed red lines) still capture the center well.

## Summary types

> Bivariate summary techniques differ depending on the data types of the variables.

| Question                                                                                                   | Comparison  type            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Did genotype frequencies differ by race or sex among study participants?                                   | categorical/categorical |
| Were differential changes in arm strength observed according to genotype?                                  | numeric/categorical     |
| Did change in arm strength appear related in any way to body size among study participants?                | numeric/numeric         |
| Did study participants experience similar or different changes in arm strength depending on arm dominance? | *??*                    |

## Categorical/categorical

<!-- *Did genotype frequencies differ by sex among study participants?* -->

A **contingency table** is a bivariate tabular summary of two categorical variables; it shows the frequency of each pair of values. Usually the marginal totals are also shown.

```{r}
tbl <- table(famuss$sex, famuss$actn3.r577x) 

cbind(tbl, total = rowSums(tbl)) %>%
  rbind(total = c(colSums(tbl), sum(tbl))) %>%
  pander()
```

There are multiple ways to convert to proportions by using different denominators, and these yield proportions with distinct interpretations:

-   grand total -- frequency of genotype/sex combination
-   row total -- genotype frequency by sex
-   column total -- sex frequency by genotype

## Categorical/categorical

*Did genotype frequencies differ by sex among study participants?*

For this question, the **row totals** should be used to convert to proportions.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
As a table:

```{r}
tbl_rowsums <- (tbl/rowSums(tbl)) 
cbind(tbl_rowsums, total = rowSums(tbl_rowsums)) %>% pander()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
As a stacked bar plot:

```{r, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3}
par(mar = c(3, 2, 1, 5), cex = 1.5)
barplot(t(tbl_rowsums), 
        horiz = T, 
        legend = T,
        args.legend = list(x = 1.6, y = 2))
```
:::
:::

The proportions are quite close, suggesting minimal sex differences.

## Categorical/categorical

*Did sex frequencies differ by genotype among study participants?*

For this question, the **column totals** should be used to compute proportions.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
As a table:

```{r}
tbl_colsums <- (t(tbl)/colSums(tbl))  %>% t() 
rbind(tbl_colsums, total = colSums(tbl_colsums)) %>% pander()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
As a stacked bar plot:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
par(mar = c(3, 2, 1, 6), cex = 1.5)
barplot(tbl_colsums, 
        legend.text = c('M', 'F'),
        args.legend = list(x = 5.5, y = 1))
```
:::
:::

The proportions are close, suggesting minimal genotype differences.

## Numeric/categorical

Side-by-side boxplots are usually a good option. Avoid stacked histograms.

*Were differential changes in arm strength observed according to genotype?*

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
    mar = c(5, 5, 3, 1),
    cex = 1.25)
boxplot(ndrm.ch ~ actn3.r577x, 
        data = famuss, 
        horizontal = T,
        range = 2,
        main = 'nondominant',
        xlab = 'percent change', 
        ylab = 'genotype')
boxplot(drm.ch ~ actn3.r577x, 
        data = famuss, 
        horizontal = T,
        range = 2,
        main = 'dominant',
        xlab = 'percent change', 
        ylab = 'genotype')
```
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
Look for differences:

-   location shift
-   spread
-   center

*What do you think? Any notable relationships?*
:::
:::

## Numeric/numeric

*Did change in arm strength appear related in any way to body size among study participants?*

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 3),
    mar = c(2, 5, 1, 1),
    cex = 1.5)
plot(famuss$height, famuss$ndrm.ch, xlab = '', ylab = 'nondominant', main = 'height')
plot(famuss$weight, famuss$ndrm.ch, xlab = '', ylab = '', main = 'weight')
plot(famuss$bmi, famuss$ndrm.ch, xlab = '', ylab = '', main = 'bmi')
plot(famuss$height, famuss$drm.ch, xlab = '', ylab = 'dominant', main = '')
plot(famuss$weight, famuss$drm.ch, xlab = '', ylab = '', main = '')
plot(famuss$bmi, famuss$drm.ch, xlab = '', ylab = '', main = '')

```

Pairwise scatterplots indicate no apparent relationships.

## Interpreting scatterplots

> Scatterplots show the presence or absence of an **association**.

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
par(mar = c(5, 5, 1, 1),
    cex.main = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 1.5)
plot(height, weight)
fit <- lm(log(weight) ~ height)
pred <- predict(fit, interval = 'prediction') |> 
  exp() |>
  as_data_frame() |>
  mutate(height = height) |>
  arrange(height)
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$fit, col = 'blue')
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$lwr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$upr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
If there is an association (*i.e.,* discernible pattern), it can be:

- linear or nonlinear

    + linear if scatter roughly follows a straight line, nonlinear otherwise
    
- positive or negative

    + positive if scatter is increasing from left to right, negative otherwise

The plot at left is an example of a positive and (slightly) nonlinear relationship.

## Correlation

In addition to graphical techniques, for numeric/numeric comparisons, there are also quantiative measures of relationship.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](img/correlations.png){width="600"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Correlation** measures the strength of linear relationship, and is defined as: $$r_{xy} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\frac{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_x s_y}$$

-   $r \rightarrow 1$: *positive* relationship
-   $r \rightarrow -1$: *negative* relationship
-   $r \rightarrow 0$: no relationship
:::
:::


## Interpreting correlations

*Did change in arm strength appear related in any way to body size among study participants?*

Here are the correlations corresponding to the plots we checked earlier.

```{r}
cor_mx <- famuss %>%
  select(drm.ch, ndrm.ch, height, weight, bmi) %>%
  cor()

cor_mx[3:5, 1:2] %>%
  t() %>%
  pander()
```

So there aren't any linear relationships here. A rule of thumb:

-   $|r| < 0.3$: no relationship
-   $0.3 \leq |r| < 0.6$: weak to moderate relationship
-   $0.6 \leq |r| < 1$: moderate to strong relationship
-   $|r| = 1$: either a mistake or not real data

## Data transformations

Sometimes a simple transformation can reveal a linear relationship on an alternate scale.

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(5, 5, 3, 1),
    cex.main = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 1.5)
plot(height, weight, main = 'original scale')
fit <- lm(log(weight) ~ height)
pred <- predict(fit, interval = 'prediction') |> 
  exp() |>
  as_data_frame() |>
  mutate(height = height) |>
  arrange(height)
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$fit, col = 'blue')
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$lwr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$upr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
```

```{r, echo = T}
# correlation coefficient
cor(height, weight)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(5, 5, 3, 1),
    cex.main = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 1.5)
plot(height, log(weight), main = 'transformed scale')
fit <- lm(log(weight) ~ height)
pred <- predict(fit, interval = 'prediction') |> 
  as_data_frame() |>
  mutate(height = height) |>
  arrange(height)
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$fit, col = 'blue')
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$lwr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$upr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
```

```{r, echo = T}
# correlation coefficient
cor(height, log(weight))
```

## Interpretation

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5}
par(mar = c(5, 5, 1, 1),
    cex.main = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.axis = 1.5)
plot(height, log(weight), main = '')
fit <- lm(log(weight) ~ height)
pred <- predict(fit, interval = 'prediction') |>

lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$lwr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
lines(x = pred$height, y = pred$upr, col = 'blue', lty = 2)
```

```{r, echo = T}
# correlation coefficient
cor(height, log(weight))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Applying these rules of thumb:

-   $|r| < 0.3$: minimal association
-   $0.3 \leq |r| < 0.6$: weak to moderate
-   $0.6 \leq |r| < 1$: moderate to strong

And:

- $r > 0$: positive association
- $r < 0$: negative association

The interpretation is:

*There is a moderately strong positive linear relationship between height and log weight.*
