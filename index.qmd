### Course information

Read the \[[course syllabus](content/syllabus.qmd)\] for detailed information on content, materials, learning outcomes, assessments, and course policies.

**Instructor:** Trevor Ruiz (he/him/his) \[[email](mailto:truiz01@calpoly.edu)\]

**Class meetings:**

-   \[Section 05\] 12:10pm — 2:00pm MW Construction Innovations Center Room C100
-   \[Section 06\] 2:10pm — 4:00pm MW Construction Innovations Center Room C100

**Office hours:** 8:10am — 11:00am Mondays 25-236 or Zoom \[[by appointment](https://calendly.com/tdruiz/office-hour)\]

**Preparing for class meetings:**

1.  Check the course website for posted reading, materials, and assignments.
2.  Complete readings *in advance* of the class meetings for which they are listed.
3.  Write down one question you have about the reading and bring it to class.
4.  Download and/or print a copy of the posted course notes (slides) for you to annotate and bring them to class.

**Completing assignments:**

One set of practice problems is included at the end of each lab; these problem sets are your homework assignments. You will often have some time to work on them during class, and they will be due by the following class period. To complete these assignments:

1.  Review the prompts included with the lab.
2.  Do your work (calculations, making plots, etc.) in the lab script provided in Posit Cloud.
3.  Follow the link that appears as \[[problem set]{style="color:blue"}\] with the class meeting outline for the period in which the problem set was assigned. This will direct you to a form where you'll fill out select answers. Refer to your work in Posit Cloud as you complete the form.

Some general remarks:

-   problem sets are due one hour before the next class meeting
-   late submissions are accepted until 5pm two days after the due date
-   score summaries will be posted once all deadlines pass
-   once scores are posted, you can see your individual responses using the link that you used to access the form
