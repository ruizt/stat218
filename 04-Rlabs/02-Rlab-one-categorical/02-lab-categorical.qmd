Officials noticed that competitors in the combat sports of boxing, tae kwon do, Greco-Roman wrestling, and freestyle wrestling are randomly assigned red or blue uniforms. For each match in the 2004 Olympics, they recorded the uniform color of the athlete who won.

```{r data}
# load the data
athletes <- read_csv("data/athletes.csv")
```

1.  **Click on the data set to open it up in the data previewer. What is the observational unit for this study?**

Your answer goes here.

# Visualizing One Categorical Variable

Let's start by exploring how many matches in our data set were won by each uniform color

2.  **Create a [*frequency bar plot*]{.underline} of the variable `color`.**

**Step 1:** Set-up the data and the variable(s) of interest

**Step 2:** Define what geometric object should be plotted on the plot -- now we're using bars!

**Step 3:** Declare nice x- and y-axis labels

Let's carry out these steps in the code chunk below!

```{r freq-barplot}
ggplot(data = athletes, 
       mapping = aes(x = ____)
       ) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  labs(title = "______",
       x = "____", 
       y = "____")
```

We could also choose to display the data as a proportion in a [***relative frequency bar plot**.*]{.underline} To find the relative frequency, we divide the count in each level by the total sample size. The resulting values are sample proportions.

To get *proportions* instead of *counts* we need to override the default statistic `geom_bar(stat = "count")` wants to use. To do this, we tell it we want proportions on the y-axis. We do this using the following code:

```         
geom_bar(stat = "count",
         aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1)
         )
```

Notice, there are two periods (**..**) before **and** after prop. These periods are necessary to define a new statistic that should be used for the y-axis.

3.  **Use this new code to modify the code you had previously. Copy-and-paste your code from the frequency bar plot above and change the y-axis to plot proportions instead of counts. Make sure to change your y-axis label to match proportions rather than counts!**

```{r relative-freq-barplot}
# Copy-and-paste your code from #2
# Add the aes() input to geom_bar() so your plot has proportions instead of counts!


```

4.  **Try removing the `group = 1` input from `geom_bar()`. What happens? What do your bars look like? Once you've answered the question, make sure to put the `group = 1` back in to your code!**

# Summary statistics for categorical variables

The other part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is making summary statistics. For a categorical variable, this means making frequency tables and relative frequency tables. Let's explore how to do that.

For this piece you are going to learn about a tool -- "the pipe." This is a special operator written as \|`>`. The pipe is used as a connecting piece to keep your data flowing through a pipeline. We will use the pipe to string together two R functions:

-   `count()`, which counts the number of observations (rows) for each group of a categorical variable
-   `mutate()`, which modifies our dataset by adding new variables or changing existing variables

Let's start with a short data pipeline.

```{r summarize}
athletes |>
  count()
```

5.  **What does the variable n tell us?**

Your answer goes here.

We can add another piece to the pipeline to make it a bit more interesting. Let's add the `won` variable into the `count()` function and see what we get!

```{r group-by-summarize}
athletes |>
  count(_____)
```

6.  **How many matches resulted in the red team winning? How many resulted in the blue team winning?**

Your answer goes here.

Finally, we might want to add one more piece to the pipeline to create a `proportion` variable of the relative frequencies of each level of `won`.

```{r group-by-summarize-mutate}
athletes |>
  count(won) |>
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))
```

7.  **What proportion of matches were won by athletes wearing red uniforms? Is this a statistic or a parameter?**

Your answer goes here.

# Scenario One: Original

[Research Question:]{.underline} Do competitors that wear red uniforms win a *majority* of the time?

8.  **State the null and alternative hypotheses in words.**

-   Null:

-   Alternative:

9. **Check the conditions for using the normal approximation method to test our hypotheses.**

10.  **Run the code below. Based on the output, what decision do you make about your hypotheses? Justify your answer using the p-value.**

```{r binom-test1}
prop_test(athletes, 
          response = won, 
          p = 0.5, 
          success = "red", 
          alternative = "greater",
          z = FALSE
          )

binom.test(x = 248, n = 457, p = 0.5, alternative = "greater")
```


11. **Write a conclusion in context of the scenario.**

# Scenario Two: One Sided vs. Two Sided

Research Question: Does one color win more often than the other?

12. **State the null and alternative hypotheses in words.**

-   Null:

-   Alternative:

13. **Change the code below to conduct a two-sided test.**

```{r binom-test2}

```

14. **Compare to scenario one (original). How is the shaded region different? How is the p-value different? What is similar and what is different about the hypothesis? Are the conclusions the same?**

::: callout-note
## Key Idea

The p-value for a two-sided test is about twice as large as that for a one-sided test. Thus the strength of evidence **decreases**. (i.e. reject the null less often).

# Scenario Three: Distance Between the Statistic and the Null

Research Question: Do competitors that wear red uniforms win a majority of the time?

-   Recall: Going back to scenario one (one-sided hypothesis), we had the following information: hypothesized null = 0.5 and observed statistic = 0.543.
-   Now suppose we observe a statistic of 0.57. (i.e. 57% of the 457 matches were won by a competitor wearing red.)

15. **How does the distance between our observed statistic and hypothesized null change? Might be helpful to draw a picture.**

16. **Run the code below. What is our p-value?**

17. **Is your p-value larger or smaller than your original one? Explain why this makes sense.**

::: callout-note
### Key Idea

As the observed sample statistic moves farther away from the hypothesized value, the strength of evidence increases. (i.e. reject the null more often.)
:::

# Scenario 4: Effect of Sample Size

Research Question: Do competitors that wear red uniforms win a majority of the time?

-   Recall: In scenario one (original) we had a sample size of 457 and a statistic of 0.543.

-   In boxing, the researchers found that out of the 272 boxing matches 150 of them were won by competitors wearing red.

    *(Note: the sample statistic of 150/272 = 0.551 is similar to the original sample statistic from scenario 1.)*

18. **Complete the code below to import the boxing data.**

```{r boxing-data}
# load the boxing data

```

19. **Use the One Proportion applet to test our hypothesis. Click summary statistics.**

20. **Compare to the original scenario. Note the center of the distributions. How does the standard deviation change? Is the p-value larger or smaller?**

::: callout-note
## Key Idea

As the **sample size increases** (and the value of the observed sample statistic stays the same) the strength of evidence **increases.** (i.e. reject the null more).

As the **sample size decreases** (and the value of the observed sample statistic stays the same) the strength of evidence **decreases.** (i.e. reject the null less).
