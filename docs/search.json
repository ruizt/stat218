    "section": "",
    "text": "Recall that the difference between an observational study and an experiment hinges on whether researchers intentionally intervene on the system of study (experiment) or passively record outcomes (observational study). Additionally, the following common study designs were discussed:\n\nIn prospective (“looking ahead”) studies participants are recruited before developing a condition based on exposure; results look ahead to the proportions in each exposure group that develop the condition\nIn retrospective (“looking back”) studies participants are recruited after developing a condition; results look back on the proportions in each group that met certain criteria\n\nIn this activity you’ll read abstracts from a few published studies and determine, in consultation with your group, what kind of study is described in the abstract. You do not need to consider the examples in order — start with the ones that look most interesting.\n\nExample 1: long COVID\nLong COVID is a multi-systemic and often debilitating condition that develops in at least 10% of patients following a COVID infection. The following is an excerpt of the abstract from a recent study seeking to identify symptoms and risk factors associated with long COVID and published in Nature Medicine:\n\nWe undertook a … study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection … Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition … Among the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for long COVID included female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities. The risk of developing long COVID was also found to be increased along a gradient of decreasing age.\n\nSubramanian et al. (2022). Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID in non-hospitalized adults. Nature medicine, 28(8), 1706-1714.\nDiscuss the following questions with your group:\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment?\nIs this study retrospective, prospective, or neither?\n\n\n\nExample 2: selenium exposure and Mediterranean diet\nThe following is from the abstract of a study investigating dietary mitigation of selenium exposure:\n\nSelenium is a trace element found in many chemical forms. Selenium and its species have nutritional and toxicologic properties, some of which may play a role in the etiology of neurological disease. We hypothesized that adherence to the Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet could influence intake and endogenous concentrations of selenium and selenium species, thus contributing to the beneficial effects of this dietary pattern. We carried out a cross-sectional study of 137 non-smoking blood donors (75 females and 62 males) from the Reggio Emilia province, Northern Italy. We assessed MIND diet adherence using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We assessed selenium exposure through dietary intake and measurement of urinary and serum concentrations, including speciation of selenium compound in serum … Adherence to the MIND diet was positively associated with dietary selenium intake and urinary selenium excretion, whereas it was inversely associated with serum concentrations of overall selenium and organic selenium … Our results suggest that greater adherence to the MIND diet is non-linearly associated with lower circulating concentrations of selenium and of 2 potentially neurotoxic species of this element, selenoprotein P and selenate. This may explain why adherence to the MIND dietary pattern may reduce cognitive decline.\n\nUrbano, T., et al. (2023). Adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and exposure to selenium species: A cross-sectional study. Nutrition Research.\nDiscuss the following questions with your group:\n\nDoes the abstract describe an observational study or an experiment?\nIs this study prospective, retrospective, or neither?\nConsider the finding that MIND adherence is associated with lower circulating concentrations of selenium. Does this provide evidence that adoption of the MIND diet is likely to reduce selenium concentrations? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nExample 3: fermented kimchi and glucose metabolism\nThe following is from an abstract of a study investigating possible benefits of kimchi consumption among prediabetic individuals:\n\nWith the increased incidence of diabetes mellitus, the importance of early intervention in prediabetes has been emphasized … We hypothesized that kimchi and its fermented form would have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in patients with prediabetes. A total of 21 participants with prediabetes were enrolled. During the first 8 weeks, they consumed either fresh (1-day-old) or fermented (10-day-old) kimchi. After a 4-week washout period, they switched to the other type of kimchi for the next 8 weeks. Consumption of both types of kimchi significantly decreased body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Fermented kimchi decreased insulin resistance, and increased insulin sensitivity … Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly in the fermented kimchi group. The percentages of participants who showed improved glucose tolerance were 9.5 and 33.3% in the fresh and fermented kimchi groups, respectively.\n\nAn, S. Y., et al. (2013). Beneficial effects of fresh and fermented kimchi in prediabetic individuals. Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, 63(1-2), 111-119.\nDiscuss the following questions with your group:\n\nDoes the abstract describe an observational study or an experiment?\nIs this study retrospective, prospective, or neither?\nConsider the finding that a third of participants consuming fermented kimchi showed improved glucose tolerance. Does this provide evidence that consuming fermented kimchi is likely to improve glucose tolerance? Would you answer differently if the study had found that number were 8 in 10?\n\n\n\nExample 4: Moderna vaccine efficacy\nFrom the journal publication reporting clinical trial results for the Moderna COVID vaccine:\n\nVaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19.

    "title": "Lab 1: R Basics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This lab is intended to introduce you to the nuts and bolts of R: arithmetic operations, data types, vectors, and other data structures. While you won’t be expected to do much data manipulation for this class, it will be helpful for you to have some understanding of data structures and how to do basic calculations going forward.\nThis lab covers a lot of ground; consider it a reference you can return to later as needed.\n\nArithmetic operations\nWhile R does a lot more than function as a calculator, it can be used to perform basic arithmetic. All of the usual operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation — can be performed as shown below.\n\n# addition\n2 + 1 \n\n# subtraction\n2 - 1\n\n# multiplication\n2*3\n\n# division\n2/3\n\n# exponentiation\n3^2\n\n# parentheses for order of operations: compare\n(2 + 1)/4\n2 + 1/4\n\nBasic functions can also be evaluated. To name a few:\n\n# square root\nsqrt(9)\n\n# exponential function e^x\nexp(1)\n\n# logarithm: compare, default base is e (i.e., natural log)\nlog(2, base = exp(1))\nlog(2)\n\nThe result of each of these calculations is a value. Values are elementary objects in the R environment and can thus be assigned names using the assignment operator &lt;-:\n\n# store a value\nx &lt;- log(2)\n\n# display named value\nx\n\nNames can consist of any combination of letters, numbers, and the delimiters _ and .; names cannot start with numbers.\nIf a name is used multiple times, the most recently assigned value will be stored. However, ‘most recent’ in this context means ‘most recently executed’: R will not pay attention to the order of lines in your script, but the order in which you run them. To see this, try redefining x to be a new value. if you then go back and run the previous line that displays the value, you’ll notice you get the new value, not the old one, even though the line appears before the new assignment.\n\n# assign a new value the name 'x': this overwrites the first value\nx &lt;- 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nWrite one line of code each to perform the following calculations:\n\nCalculate the sum of the ages of each member of your group, in years.\nHow about in months? Multiply by 12.\nCalculate the average number of siblings among the members of your group.\n\n\n# sum of ages of group members\n\n# convert to months: multiply by 12\n\n# average number of siblings among group members\n\n\n\n\n\nData types\nValues may be of different types. The function class(...) will return the “class” of object it is given; for values, the object class is simply the data type.\nThere are four main data types in R.\n\n# numeric\nclass(12)\n\n# character\nclass('text')\n\n# logical\nclass(TRUE)\n\n# integer\nclass(12L)\n\nArithmetic only works with logical, integer, and numeric values:\n\n# valid operations\n12*12\n12L*12\n12L*12L\n12*TRUE\n12*FALSE\n12L*TRUE\n12L*FALSE\n\nIt will not work with character values:\n\n# invalid operation\n'12'*'12'\n\nError in \"12\" * \"12\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the product of TRUE and FALSE. Which data type results from this operation?\nWhat do you think will happen if you add a logical and numeric value? Discuss first, then verify.\nWhat kind of value does each of the above operations return? Discuss first, then verify.\n\n\n# product of true and false\n\n# add a logical and numeric value\n\n# check data type of the above\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors\nIn practice, data usually consists of multiple values, not just one; in R, the most basic type of collection of values is called a vector. Technically, a vector is a “concatenation” of values of the same data type. Vectors can be formed using the concatenation function c(...):\n\n# concatenate values with c(...) to form a vector\nc(1, 2, 3)\n\n# store it\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\n\n# data type\nclass(x)\n\nIf values of different types are concatenated, they are coerced to the same data type; vectors cannot contain values of mixed type. The lines below demonstrate this behavior:\n\n# integer and logical -&gt; integer\nclass(c(2L, TRUE))\n\n# integer and numeric -&gt; numeric\nclass(c(2L, 12))\n\n# numeric and logical -&gt; numeric\nclass(c(12, TRUE))\n\n# character and anything -&gt; character\nclass(c('text', TRUE))\nclass(c('text', 2L))\nclass(c('text', 12))\n\n\nVectorization\nArithmetic between vectors is carried out elementwise; arithmetic operations between vectors and values are ‘vectorized’, meaning operations are applied over each element. This makes certain calculations quite efficient. The following examples illustrate vectorized arithmetic operations in two verbose ways: first as an elementwise operation between two vectors; then as a concatenation of the results of each elementwise operation.\n\n# equivalent\n2*c(1, 2, 3) # vectorized\nc(2, 2, 2)*c(1, 2, 3) # verbose\nc(2*1, 2*2, 2*3) # verbose\n\n# equivalent\nc(1, 2, 3) + 1 # vectorized\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(1, 1, 1) # verbose\nc(1 + 1, 2 + 1, 3 + 1) # verbose\n\n# equivalent\nc(1, 2, 3)/3 # vectorized\nc(1, 2, 3)/c(3, 3, 3) # verbose\nc(1/3, 2/3, 3/3) # verbose\n\n# equivalent\nc(1, 2, 3)^2 # vectorized\nc(1, 2, 3)^c(2, 2, 2) # verbose\nc(1^2, 2^2, 3^2) # verbose\n\nIf an operation is carried out between vectors of different lengths, a warning is printed indicating as much.\n\n# can you figure out what calculation was performed?\nc(1, 2, 3)*c(4, 5)\n\nWarning in c(1, 2, 3) * c(4, 5): longer object length is not a multiple of\nshorter object length\n\n\n[1]  4 10 12\n\n\nMany functions, including those mentioned at the outset, are also vectorized (distributed elementwise).\n\nsqrt(c(1, 4, 9))\nlog(c(1, 10, 100), base = 10)\nexp(c(0, 1, 2))\n\n\n\nIndexing\nElements of vectors are indexed by consecutive integers; elements can be retrieved by specifying the indices in square brackets after the object name.\n\n# define a vector\nx &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40)\n\n# second element\nx[2]\n\n# first and third elements\nx[c(1, 3)]\n\n# second through fourth elements\nx[2:4]\n\n\n\nMissing values\nMany datasets have missing values that occur for various reasons: equipment failure, participant dropout, survey nonresponse, and so on. These can be represented in R as well. This is useful as a means of retaining the information that there is an observation that was somehow lost. Missing values are displayed as the special character NA in R.\n\n# vector with a missing third element\nc(1, 2, NA, 4)\n\n# note: still numeric\nclass(c(1, 2, NA, 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\n\nCreate a vector with the ages of each person in your group (in years). Call it ages.\nConvert to months using vectorized arithmetic.\nNow pretend one of you is absent; repeat (1) but replace their age by a missing value. call the vector ages_incomplete.\nConvert to months again using the same operation as in (2); how is the missing value handled?\n\n\n# vector of ages in years\n\n# convert to months with vectorized arithmetic\n\n# pretend one person is absent: input a missing value\n\n# repeat conversion to months: how is the NA handled?\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrices, arrays, lists, and data frames\nMatrices can be constructed from vectors by specifying row and column dimensions, and how to arrange the values – by row or by column.\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\nmatrix(data = x, nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    3    4\n\n\nWe won’t really see arrays much, but since they are mentioned in the reading, here’s an example of how to construct one, and how it is displayed.\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\narray(data = x, dim = c(2, 2, 2))\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    5    7\n[2,]    6    8\n\n\nA list is a highly general data structure; it’s just an indexed amalgamation of objects of any type.\n\n# make a list\nlist('anchor', c(22, 5), log)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"anchor\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 22  5\n\n[[3]]\nfunction (x, base = exp(1))  .Primitive(\"log\")\n\n# the list elements can be named, which makes for easy retrieval\nmy_list &lt;- list(words = 'anchor', numbers = c(22, 5), functions = log)\nmy_list$words\n\n[1] \"anchor\"\n\n# even so, indexing can still be used\nmy_list[[1]]\n\n[1] \"anchor\"\n\n\nData frames are like lists, except each element is a vector of the same length; they appear much like matrices, but behave differently in important ways.\n\n# make a data frame\ndata.frame(col1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n           col2 = c(T, F, T, T), \n           col3 = c('red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'))\n\n  col1  col2   col3\n1    1  TRUE    red\n2    2 FALSE   blue\n3    3  TRUE  green\n4    4  TRUE yellow\n\n# unlike matrices, however, columns can be retrieved by name\nmy_df &lt;- data.frame(number = c(1, 2, 3, 4), \n                    truth = c(T, F, T, T), \n                    color = c('red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'))\nmy_df$color\n\n[1] \"red\"    \"blue\"   \"green\"  \"yellow\"\n\n\nData frames are the fundamental data structure on which a large portion of R software is built. When data files are read into R, as you saw very briefly earlier, they are read in by default as data frames. Many R functions used in performing data analyses require data to be supplied as a data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nCreate a data frame in which each row corresponds to one member of your group and columns are the variables age, number of siblings, and favorite singer.\n\n# data frame with columns age, no. of siblings, and favorite singer; each row corresponds to one group member"

Your research question is, “does knowledge about injury prevention during physical activity and exercise reduce the risk of injury?”. Imagine that ASI offers a short injury prevention training.\nYour initial study proposal is as follows:\n\n150 Cal Poly students will be selected for the study: 75 from among those who completed the injury prevention training voluntarily, and 75 from among those who did not. Participants will be followed for a year to determine how many in each group experience an injury related to physical activity at any point during the study period. At the end of the study, injury rates will be compared between those that participated in the injury prevention training and those that did not.\n\n\n[L2] Is this an observational study or an experiment? Explain your answer.\n[L1] How would you go about selecting study participants at random? Propose a specific means of identifying and contacting students to participate in the study.\n[L2] Imagine you found that those who completed the training are less likely to experience injury. Are these results potentially subject to confounding? If you answer yes, give a hypothetical example of a confounding factor; if you answer no, explain why confounding is not a concern.\n[L1] If you answered that it is an observational study, propose an experiment that would address the same question. If you answered that it is an experiment, propose an observational study that would address the same question.\n[L2] Suppose the alternate study you proposed in (4) indicated that those who completed the training are less likely to experience injury. Are these results potentially subject to confounding? If so, give a hypothetical example of a confounding factor; if not, explain why confounding is not a concern.\nIs the original proposal a retrospective or prospective study? Explain your answer.\nIf you answered that it is retrospective, determine an alternate study to investigate the same research question that is instead prospective; if you answered that it is prospective, determine an alternate study that is retrospective. Write a short proposal similar to the above for your alternate study."

Each infant was randomly assigned to peanut consumption (6g peanut protein per day) or peanut avoidance (no peanut consumption) groups. At 5 years of age, an allergy test was administered to each study participant; the rates of peanut allergy were compared between the two groups.\n\n\n[L1] Propose a retrospective observational study to investigate the research question, “is early peanut exposure associated with a lower risk of developing peanut allergies?” Include a specific description of how you might enroll participants."

    "text": "Statistics plays a crucial role in the sciences: statistical techniques provide a means of weighing quantitative evidence derived from observation and experimentation in the face of uncertainty. Statistical thinking and data analysis also facilitate discovery, exploration, and hypothesis generation. Likewise, the sciences play a crucial role in statistics: technological and knowledge innovations in methods of scientific investigation motivate the development of new statistical methods for data analysis.\nThis class aims to provide a hands-on introduction to common statistical methods used almost universally across the sciences — descriptive and graphical techniques, inferential methods for comparing population means, analysis of categorical data and contingency tables, and linear regression — while drawing on examples from the life sciences to help illuminate the potential for application in students’ chosen field(s) of study and providing basic training in the use of statistical software. The class also creates a unique opportunity for students to interact broadly and make connections across majors and class standing.\n\nCourse information\nInstructor: Trevor Ruiz (he/him/his) [email]\nClass meetings:\n\n[Section 05/8273] 2:10pm — 4:00pm TR Construction Innovations Center Room C202\n[Section 06/8274] 4:10pm — 6:00pm TR Business Room 113\n\nClass meetings will comprise a mixture of lecture, lab activities, class activities, and discussion.\nOffice hours: 12:10pm — 2:00pm MW 25-236 or Zoom [by appointment].\nThese times are partitioned into 10 minute intervals that you can schedule via the appointment link above; this system is intended to minimize waiting times and guarantee one-on-one availability. Slots can be scheduled anywhere from 7 calendar days to 10 minutes in advance. While drop-ins are welcome, I can’t guarantee availability outside of scheduled times.\n\n\nCatalog Description\nData collection and experimental design, descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, parametric and non parametric one and two-sample hypothesis tests, analysis of variance, correlation, simple linear regression, chi-square tests. Applications of statistics to the life sciences. Substantial use of statistical software.\nPrerequisite: MATH 96; or MATH 115; or appropriate Math Placement Level.\nFulfills GE Area B4 (GE Area B1 for students on the 2019-20 or earlier catalogs); a grade of C- or better is required in one course in this GE area.\n\n\nMaterials\nTo access course materials, engage in class, and complete assignments, you’ll need an internet-connected (a) laptop or (b) tablet with a keyboard — the keyboard is necessary since we will do some web-hosted computation and you will be expected to type assignments. I’ll let you know in advance when you need to bring a laptop/tablet to class. Besides your personal computer, all materials are free.\nTextbooks:\n\nVu and Harrington (2020).

A PDF can be obtained through the Kennedy Library via the link above. This text provides a thorough introduction to biostatistics (statistics for life sciences) and is an excellent reference for more depth of coverage. Select readings will be assigned from this book.\nDouglas et al. (2023). An Introduction to R. This online book covers a variety of introductory topics pertaining to R/RStudio: installation, packages, files and directories, objects, functions, data types, data structures, graphics, basic statistics, markdown, and version control.

To access the workspace, you’ll need to create a (free) posit.cloud account — open the invitation by clicking the link above and follow prompts. Activities and assignments will be distributed via this workspace. Please be aware that any files you create on the workspace will be visible to admins.\nCourse notes: notes to supplement readings will be posted as needed on the course website.\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nThe course aims to enable you to demonstrate the following abilities.\n\n[L1] design a data collection scheme based on simple random sampling or simple experimental designs\n[L2] distinguish between observational studies and experiments and understand the limitations (practical and consequential) of each\n[L3] summarize data using graphical and numerical techniques\n[L4] construct and interpret confidence intervals for means and differences between means for independent and paired samples\n[L5] conduct parametric and non-parametric two-sample hypothesis tests for means\n[L6] construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single proportion\n[L7] conduct Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and tests for independence\n[L8] distinguish between case-control and cohort studies and compute relative-risk and odds in the appropriate settings\n[L9] perform analysis of variance tests and post-hoc comparisons for completely randomized designs\n[L10] use simple linear regression to describe relationships between variables\n[L11] apply one or more methods from the course to your major field of study\n\nIn addition, you will learn to perform simple analyses and computations in R and can expect to attain a basic level of proficiency with the software; however, as this is not a programming class, emphasis will be placed on obtaining and interpreting relevant outputs in the context of the analyses indicated above.\n\n\nAssessments\nAttainment of learning outcomes will be measured by performance on homework assignments, tests, and a final oral exam.\nHomeworks are your opportunity to practice using course concepts and methods covered in class and comprise both graded and ungraded questions, marked as such. Graded questions will be largely data analytic and will correspond to specific marked learning outcomes; responses will be assessed as satisfactory (S) or needing improvement (NI) according to whether they are fully correct, and qualitative feedback will be offered if an assessment of NI is given. Ungraded questions are entirely for your benefit as extra practice. You can submit revisions to any graded responses needing improvement for reassessment.\nTests are your opportunity to demonstrate that you’ve synthesized course material and achieved learning outcomes. Tests will comprise sets of questions, some conceptual and some data analytic, corresponding to specific marked learning outcomes. Responses will be assessed as satisfactory (S) or needing improvement (NI) according to whether they are fully correct, and qualitative feedback will be offered if an assessment of NI is given. You will be given a 24 hour window to complete each test, and you can submit revisions to responses needing improvement.\nThe final oral exam will require you to find an application of course material in the field of your major and present it as a case study in 5 minutes. You will be expected to describe the research question, study design, analysis, and conclusion, and answer 1-2 questions. These will be carried out in private and scheduled during the final exam time. This assignment applies to learning outcome L11 only, and you will receive an assessment of ‘fully met’, ‘partly met’, or ‘unmet’ for that outcome depending on your presentation and ability to answer questions. A rubric will be provided in advance to clearly define the expectations associated with each possible assessment.\n\n\nLetter grades\nStudents will receive a score for each learning outcome representing the weighted proportion of questions matched with that outcome that received a satisfactory assessment across all assignments, with relatively more weight given to questions from tests. The outcome will be determined as ‘fully met’ if the weighted proportion is at least 0.8, ‘partly met’ if the weighted proportion is between 0.5 and 0.8, and ‘unmet’ otherwise. To receive a passing grade in the class, at least six outcomes must be partly met. Letter grades are then defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nMinimum number of partly + fully met outcomes\nMinimum number of fully met outcomes\n\n\n\n\nA\n10\n9\n\n\nA-\n10\n8\n\n\nB+\n8\n7\n\n\nB\n8\n6\n\n\nB-\n8\n5\n\n\nC+\n6\n5\n\n\nC\n6\n4\n\n\nC-\n6\n3\n\n\nD+\n6\n2\n\n\nD\n6\n1\n\n\nD-\n6\n0\n\n\n\nPlease note that these definitions are tentative and potentially subject to change. Please also note that failure to adhere to course policies — particularly collaboration, academic integrity, and attendance policies — may result in a lower letter grade than would otherwise be assigned.\n\n\nTentative schedule\nSubject to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTopics\nReadings (V&H)\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n1 (1/8/24)\nIntroduction to statistical thinking and study design\n1.1\nHW1\n\n\n2 (1/15/24)\nData, data types, and data collection\n1.2\nNone\n\n\n3 (1/22/24)\nFoundations for inference\n1.4 – 1.5; 4.1\nHW2\n\n\n4 (1/29/24)\nInterval estimation and hypothesis tests\n4.2 – 4.3\nTest 1\n\n\n5 (2/5/24)\nTwo-sample inference for numerical data; nonparametric alternatives\n5.1 — 5.3\nHW3\n\n\n6 (2/12/24)\nComparing means with analysis of variance\n5.4\nHW4\n\n\n7 (2/19/24)\nInference for categorical data: proportions\n8.1 — 8.2\nTest 2\n\n\n8 (2/26/24)\nInference for categorical data: chi-square tests\n8.3 — 8.4\nHW5\n\n\n9 (3/4/24)\nSimple linear regression: model framework and estimation\n6.1 — 6.3\nHW6\n\n\n10 (3/11/24)\nSimple linear regression: inference\n6.4 — 6.5\nTest 3\n\n\nFinals (3/18/24)\nN/A\nN/A\nOral exam\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse policies\n\nCollaboration\nCollaboration within the class and across class sections is allowed and encouraged on homework assignments, subject to certain conditions outlined in the paragraph below. Collaborations should not include individuals outside of the class. Students collaborating with a group are expected to prepare their own assignment submissions, in their own words and writing, and should to indicate their collaborators in writing on their submission. This is limited to peers that were consulted closely in completing the assignment; brief or passing interactions are not considered collaborations.\nA collaboration is a shared effort. Students that choose to work together on homework assignments are expected to make material contributions towards producing one or more shared answers or solutions. Material contributions might include participation in discussions, critique of a proposed solution, or presentation of a problem approach. In the absence of such contributions, submitting solutions prepared in a group is not appropriate. The best way to adhere to this policy is to attempt problems individually before consulting others and exchanging work.\n\n\nAttendance\nRegular attendance is essential for success in the course and required per University policy. Each student may miss two class meetings without notice but additional absences should be excusable and students should notify the instructor. Unexcused absences may negatively impact course grades.\n\n\nCommunication and email\nStudents are encouraged to use face-to-face means of communication (office hours, class meetings, appointments) when possible. Email may be used on a secondary basis or when a written record of communication is needed. Every effort is made to respond to email within 48 weekday hours — so a message sent Thursday or Friday may not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday. Time-sensitive messages should be identified as such in the subject line. For non-time-sensitive messages, please wait one week before sending a reminder.\n\n\nTime commitment\nSTAT218 is a four-credit course, which corresponds to a minimum time commitment of 12 hours per week, including lectures, reading, assignments, and study time. Some variability in workload by week should be expected, and most students will need to budget a few extra hours each week. However, students can expect to be able to meet course expectations with a time commitment of 12-16 hours per week. Considering that lecture accounts for four hours per week, students should anticipate devoting 8-12 hours outside of class.\n\n\nAssignment scores and final grades\nEvery effort will be made to provide consistent, fair, and accurate evaluation of student work. Students should notify the instructor of any suspected errors or discrepancies in evaluation promptly on an assignment-by-assignment basis (i.e., not at the end of the quarter) to guarantee consideration. Final (letter) grades will only be changed in the case of clerical errors. Attempting to negotiate scores or final grades is not appropriate.\nPer University policy, faculty have final responsibility for grading criteria and grading judgment and have the right to alter student assessment or other parts of the syllabus during the term. If any student feels their grade is unfairly assigned at the end of the course, they have the right to appeal it according to the procedure outlined here.\n\n\nDeadlines and late work\nEach student may turn in two homework assignments up to one week late without penalty at any time during the quarter and without notice. Subsequently, late work will incur a penalty in final grade calculations unless an extension is granted in advance. As a general policy, late work will be not accepted beyond one week after the original due date. Deadlines for tests are strict.\nThese policies are intended to provide you with some flexibility to work around unforeseen circumstances while maintaining accountability for completing coursework in a timely manner. That said, if any circumstances arise that the policies do not accommodate well, please let me know and I will do my best to work with you to keep you on track in the course. Exceptions may be granted for significant and unforeseen challenges (medical absences, family emergencies, and the like).\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Accommodation requests should be made through the Disability Resource Center (DRC).\n\n\nConduct and Academic Integrity\nStudents are expected to be aware of and adhere to University policy regarding academic integrity and conduct. Detailed information on these policies, and potential repercussions of policy violations, can be found via the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities (OSRR).\nInstances of academic dishonesty will be reported to OSRR and will result in penalty ranging from credit reduction to grade reduction to course failure, depending on the severity of the situation.\n\n\nCopyright and distribution of course materials\nAll course materials, including handouts, homework assignments, lab assignments, study guides, course notes, exams, and solutions are subject to copyright; students are not permitted to share or distribute any course materials without the written consent of the instructor. This includes, in particular, uploading materials or prepared solutions to online services and sharing materials or prepared solutions with students who may take the course in a future term. Transgressions of this policy compromise the effectiveness of instruction and assessment and do a disservice to current and future students."
