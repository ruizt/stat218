    "section": "",
    "text": "Recall that the difference between an observational study and an experiment hinges on whether researchers intentionally intervene on the system of study (experiment) or passively record outcomes (observational study). Additionally, the following common study designs were discussed:\n\nIn prospective (“looking ahead”) studies participants are recruited before developing a condition based on exposure; results look ahead to the proportions in each exposure group that develop the condition\nIn retrospective (“looking back”) studies participants are recruited after developing a condition; results look back on the proportions in each group that met certain criteria\n\nIn this activity you’ll read abstracts from a few published studies and determine, in consultation with your group, what kind of study is described in the abstract. You do not need to consider the examples in order — start with the ones that look most interesting.\n\nExample 1: long COVID\nLong COVID is a multi-systemic and often debilitating condition that develops in at least 10% of patients following a COVID infection. The following is an excerpt of the abstract from a recent study seeking to identify symptoms and risk factors associated with long COVID and published in Nature Medicine:\n\nWe undertook a … study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection … Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition … Among the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for long COVID included female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities. The risk of developing long COVID was also found to be increased along a gradient of decreasing age.\n\nSubramanian et al. (2022). Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID in non-hospitalized adults. Nature medicine, 28(8), 1706-1714.\nDiscuss the following questions with your group:\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment?\nIs this study retrospective, prospective, or neither?\n\n\n\nExample 2: selenium exposure and Mediterranean diet\nThe following is from the abstract of a study investigating dietary mitigation of selenium exposure:\n\nSelenium is a trace element found in many chemical forms. Selenium and its species have nutritional and toxicologic properties, some of which may play a role in the etiology of neurological disease. We hypothesized that adherence to the Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet could influence intake and endogenous concentrations of selenium and selenium species, thus contributing to the beneficial effects of this dietary pattern. We carried out a cross-sectional study of 137 non-smoking blood donors (75 females and 62 males) from the Reggio Emilia province, Northern Italy. We assessed MIND diet adherence using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We assessed selenium exposure through dietary intake and measurement of urinary and serum concentrations, including speciation of selenium compound in serum … Adherence to the MIND diet was positively associated with dietary selenium intake and urinary selenium excretion, whereas it was inversely associated with serum concentrations of overall selenium and organic selenium … Our results suggest that greater adherence to the MIND diet is non-linearly associated with lower circulating concentrations of selenium and of 2 potentially neurotoxic species of this element, selenoprotein P and selenate. This may explain why adherence to the MIND dietary pattern may reduce cognitive decline.\n\nUrbano, T., et al. (2023). Adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and exposure to selenium species: A cross-sectional study. Nutrition Research.\nDiscuss the following questions with your group:\n\nDoes the abstract describe an observational study or an experiment?\nIs this study prospective, retrospective, or neither?\nConsider the finding that MIND adherence is associated with lower circulating concentrations of selenium. Does this provide evidence that adoption of the MIND diet is likely to reduce selenium concentrations? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nExample 3: fermented kimchi and glucose metabolism\nThe following is from an abstract of a study investigating possible benefits of kimchi consumption among prediabetic individuals:\n\nWith the increased incidence of diabetes mellitus, the importance of early intervention in prediabetes has been emphasized … We hypothesized that kimchi and its fermented form would have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in patients with prediabetes. A total of 21 participants with prediabetes were enrolled. During the first 8 weeks, they consumed either fresh (1-day-old) or fermented (10-day-old) kimchi. After a 4-week washout period, they switched to the other type of kimchi for the next 8 weeks. Consumption of both types of kimchi significantly decreased body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Fermented kimchi decreased insulin resistance, and increased insulin sensitivity … Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly in the fermented kimchi group. The percentages of participants who showed improved glucose tolerance were 9.5 and 33.3% in the fresh and fermented kimchi groups, respectively.\n\nAn, S. Y., et al. (2013). Beneficial effects of fresh and fermented kimchi in prediabetic individuals. Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, 63(1-2), 111-119.\nDiscuss the following questions with your group:\n\nDoes the abstract describe an observational study or an experiment?\nIs this study retrospective, prospective, or neither?\nConsider the finding that a third of participants consuming fermented kimchi showed improved glucose tolerance. Does this provide evidence that consuming fermented kimchi is likely to improve glucose tolerance? Would you answer differently if the study had found that number were 8 in 10?\n\n\n\nExample 4: Moderna vaccine efficacy\nFrom the journal publication reporting clinical trial results for the Moderna COVID vaccine:\n\nVaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. This [study] was conducted at 99 centers across the United States … The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group) … Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group; vaccine efficacy was 94.1%. \n\nBaden, L.

    "text": "This lab is intended to introduce you to the nuts and bolts of R: arithmetic operations, data types, vectors, and other data structures. While you won’t be expected to do much data manipulation or manual calculation for this class, it will be helpful for you to have some understanding of this material going forward, as most R objects are arranged as data structures comprising one or more data types.\nThis lab covers a lot of ground; consider it a reference you can return to later as needed.\n\nArithmetic operations\nWhile R does a lot more than function as a calculator, it can be used to perform basic arithmetic. All of the usual operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation — can be performed as shown below.\n\n# addition\n2 + 1 \n\n# subtraction\n2 - 1\n\n# multiplication\n2*3\n\n# division\n2/3\n\n# exponentiation\n3^2\n\n# parentheses for order of operations: compare\n(2 + 1)/4\n2 + 1/4\n\nBasic functions can also be evaluated. To name a few:\n\n# square root\nsqrt(9)\n\n# exponential function e^x\nexp(1)\n\n# logarithm: compare, default base is e (i.e., natural log)\nlog(2, base = exp(1))\nlog(2)\n\nThe result of each of these calculations is a value. Values are the most elementary objects in the R environment. Values can be assigned names using the assignment operator &lt;-:\n\n# store a value\nx &lt;- log(2)\n\n# print value in console\nx\n\nNames can consist of any combination of letters, numbers, and the delimiters _ and .; names cannot start with numbers (try it and see what happens).\nIf a name is used multiple times, the most recently assigned value will be stored. However, ‘most recent’ in this context means ‘most recently executed’: R will not pay attention to the order of lines in your script, but the order in which you run them. To see this, try redefining x to be a new value. if you then go back and run the previous line that displays the value, you’ll notice you get the new value, not the old one, even though the line appears before the new assignment.\n\n# assign a new value the name 'x': this overwrites the first value\nx &lt;- 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nWrite one line of code each to perform the following calculations:\n\nCalculate the sum of the ages of each member of your group, in years.\nHow about in months? Multiply by 12.\nCalculate the average number of siblings among the members of your group.\n\n\n# sum of ages of group members\n\n# convert to months: multiply by 12\n\n# average number of siblings among group members\n\n\n\n\n\nData types\nValues may be of different types. The function class(...) will return the “class” of object it is given; for values, the object class is simply the data type.\nThere are four main data types in R.\n\n# numeric\nclass(12)\n\n# character\nclass('text')\n\n# logical\nclass(TRUE)\n\n# integer\nclass(12L)\n\nArithmetic only works with logical, integer, and numeric values:\n\n# valid operations\n12*12\n12L*12\n12L*12L\n12*TRUE\n12*FALSE\n12L*TRUE\n12L*FALSE\n\nIt will not work with character values. Notice the text of the error message:\n\n# invalid operation\n'12'*'12'\n\nError in \"12\" * \"12\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nThis is a very common error message — when you see it, you’ll know that most likely, somewhere R attempted to perform arithmetic with character values, so it’s probably a data type issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the product of TRUE and FALSE. Which data type results from this operation?\nWhat do you think will happen if you add a logical and numeric value? Discuss first, then verify.\nWhat kind of value does each of the above operations return? Discuss first, then verify.\n\n\n# product of true and false\n\n# add a logical and numeric value\n\n# check data type of the above\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors\nIn practice, data usually consists of multiple values, not just one; in R, the most basic type of collection of values is called a vector. Technically, a vector is a “concatenation” of values of the same data type. Vectors can be formed using the concatenation function c(...):\n\n# concatenate values with c(...) to form a vector\nc(1, 2, 3)\n\n# store it\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\n\n# data type\nclass(x)\n\nIf values of different types are concatenated, they are coerced to the same data type; vectors cannot contain values of mixed type. The lines below demonstrate this behavior:\n\n# integer and logical -&gt; integer\nclass(c(2L, TRUE))\n\n# integer and numeric -&gt; numeric\nclass(c(2L, 12))\n\n# numeric and logical -&gt; numeric\nclass(c(12, TRUE))\n\n# character and anything -&gt; character\nclass(c('text', TRUE))\nclass(c('text', 2L))\nclass(c('text', 12))\n\n\nVectorization\nArithmetic between vectors is carried out elementwise; arithmetic operations between vectors and values are ‘vectorized’, meaning operations are applied over each element. This makes certain calculations quite efficient. The following examples illustrate vectorized arithmetic operations in two verbose ways: first as an elementwise operation between two vectors; then as a concatenation of the results of each elementwise operation.\n\n# equivalent\n2*c(1, 2, 3) # vectorized\nc(2, 2, 2)*c(1, 2, 3) # verbose\nc(2*1, 2*2, 2*3) # verbose\n\n# equivalent\nc(1, 2, 3) + 1 # vectorized\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(1, 1, 1) # verbose\nc(1 + 1, 2 + 1, 3 + 1) # verbose\n\n# equivalent\nc(1, 2, 3)/3 # vectorized\nc(1, 2, 3)/c(3, 3, 3) # verbose\nc(1/3, 2/3, 3/3) # verbose\n\n# equivalent\nc(1, 2, 3)^2 # vectorized\nc(1, 2, 3)^c(2, 2, 2) # verbose\nc(1^2, 2^2, 3^2) # verbose\n\nIf an operation is carried out between vectors of different lengths, a warning is printed indicating as much.\n\n# can you figure out what calculation was performed?\nc(1, 2, 3)*c(4, 5)\n\nWarning in c(1, 2, 3) * c(4, 5): longer object length is not a multiple of\nshorter object length\n\n\n[1]  4 10 12\n\n\nMany functions, including those mentioned at the outset, are also vectorized (calculations are performed elementwise).\n\nsqrt(c(1, 4, 9))\nlog(c(1, 10, 100), base = 10)\nexp(c(0, 1, 2))\n\n\n\nIndexing\nElements of vectors are indexed by consecutive integers; elements can be retrieved by specifying the indices in square brackets after the object name.\n\n# define a vector\nx &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40)\n\n# second element\nx[2]\n\n# first and third elements\nx[c(1, 3)]\n\n# second through fourth elements\nx[2:4]\n\n\n\nMissing values\nMany datasets have missing values that occur for various reasons: equipment failure, participant dropout, survey nonresponse, and so on.

    "section": "",
    "text": "By now you have seen basic descriptive and graphical summaries. But what determines when some descriptive statistics are “better” to use than others?\nThis lab has two objectives:\n\nTeach you to compute descriptive statistics and prepare graphical summaries for a single variable in R\nLearn when and why to use certain descriptive statistics in place of others\n\nWe will focus on how outliers, or observations far from center, affect different descriptive measures. In statistics, the term for this is robustness: a robust statistic is less affected by the presence of outliers.\n\nAccessing data\nFor this lab we’ll use the FAMuSS dataset, as in lecture. This dataset is stored in the oibiostat package, which is an R package companion to the Vu and Harrington textbook.\n\n# load openintro biostat package\nlibrary(oibiostat)\n\n# load famuss data\ndata(famuss)\n\n# open data documentation\n?famuss\n\nThe command above makes the dataset available in your environment as a data frame named famuss in which the columns represent variables and the rows represent observations. You can see the first few rows using head():\n\nhead(famuss)\n\n  ndrm.ch drm.ch    sex age      race height weight actn3.r577x    bmi\n1      40     40 Female  27 Caucasian   65.0    199          CC 33.112\n2      25      0   Male  36 Caucasian   71.7    189          CT 25.845\n3      40      0 Female  24 Caucasian   65.0    134          CT 22.296\n4     125      0 Female  40 Caucasian   68.0    171          CT 25.998\n5      40     20 Female  32 Caucasian   61.0    118          CC 22.293\n6      75      0 Female  24  Hispanic   62.2    120          CT 21.805\n\n\nYou can extract a vector of the observations for any particular variable from the dataframe as follows: famuss$[variable name]. We will be performing calculations one column at a time, so you’ll need to be able to extract and store a column as a new R object.\n\n# extract the age variable\nfamuss$age\n\n# extract the bmi variable\nfamuss$bmi\n\n# store the age column as a vector\nage &lt;- famuss$age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\n\n# try it yourself: pick a variable to extract and store\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical and tabular summaries\nOur most basic summaries are frequency distributions. For categorical variables, these are simply observation counts by category; for numeric variables, values must be binned and then tabulated.\nFor categorical variables (i.e., character vectors or factors):\n\ntable() will tabulate the number of occurrences of unique values in a vector\nfor a categorical variable, plot() will create a barplot of the frequency distribution\n\nFor numeric variables:\n\nhist() will create a histogram\n\n\n## categorical summaries\nrace &lt;- famuss$race\n\n# frequency distribution\ntable(race)\n\n# barplot of frequency distribution\nplot(race)\n## quantitative summaries\nage &lt;- famuss$age\n\n# histogram; 'breaks = ...' controls the binning\nhist(age, breaks = 20)\n\nA quick word about functions. The inputs to functions are called arguments. The histogram function hist() requires a data argument, in this case age, to make the plot. However, the function also has several optional arguments that control things like labels, binning, axis limits, and so on. The breaks = 20 part of the last command is an example of an optional argument. Most functions in R have optional arguments that control their behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nTry making a table, barplot, and histogram on your own with some of the other variables.\nWhen generating the histogram, adjust the number of bins using the breaks = ... argument. Experiment to see how the shape of the distribution appears at various binning resolutions; then pick a number of breaks that you feel reflects the data best.\n\n# make a table of the frequency distribution of genotypes\n\n# make a barplot of the frequency distribution of genotypes\n\n# make a histogram of dominant arm change; play with the binning!\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical summaries\nIn class we discussed several descriptive statistics for numeric variables.\n\nmeasures of center: mean, median\npercentiles: quartiles, min, max\n\nThese statistics are so commonly used that they have their own functions in R.\n\n# the median gets its own function\nmedian(age)\n\n# ditto mean\nmean(age)\n\n# ... and minimum and maximum\nmin(age)\nmax(age)\n\n# 30th percentile of age (\"quantile\" is another term for percentile)\nquantile(age, probs = 0.3)\n\n# 30th *and* 60th percentile of age\nquantile(age, probs = c(0.3, 0.6))\n\nThe five-number summary is the collection of the percentiles that give the minimum, quartiles, and maximum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nTry computing the five-number summary using a variable of your choice. Be sure you pick a numeric and not a categorical variable.\nPay attention to how the probs = ... argument to the quantile() function can be used to calculate multiple percentiles at once. Use this feature to calculate all five numbers in the five-number summary with one command.\n\n# choose a *quantiative* variable from the dataset\n\n# compute the five-number summary using quantile()\n\n# compare the mean and the median. are they close?\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the summary() command will do the work for you.\n\nsummary(age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   17.0    20.0    22.0    24.4    27.0    40.0 \n\n\n\n\nExploring robustness\nStatistics based on percentiles are in general insensitive to outliers, unless there’s a large group of outlying observations. In this sense they are robust statistics.\nAn easy way to see this is to consider the median (middle value or 50th percentile). The maximum observation could be arbitrarily large without changing the middle value, so the median will be the same whether the largest value is 10 or 10,000. The mean, by contrast, does not share this property.\n\n# make up some observations between 1 and 100\nx &lt;- sample(1:100, size = 20)\nx\n\n# median of made up observations, plus 101\nmedian(c(x, 101))\n\n# median of made up observations, plus 1M\nmedian(c(x, 1000000))\n\n# same comparison, but with mean\nmean(c(x, 101))\nmean(c(x, 1000000))\n\nSo in the presence of outliers, the median will capture the center of the distribution of values more accurately. In fact, even if the distribution is simply skewed, the mean will shift away from center.\n\n# distribution of ages is right-skewed\nhist(age)\n\n# plot the mean and median on top of the histogram\nhist(age)\nabline(v = mean(age), col = 2)\nabline(v = median(age), col = 4)\n\n\n\n\nThis difference is useful — the comparison of median and mean can indicate the direction and amount of skewness present.\n\n# mean &gt; median ---&gt; right-skewed\nsummary(age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   17.0    20.0    22.0    24.4    27.0    40.0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nCalculate the numeric summary for percent change in dominant arm strength and see if you can determine the direction and magnitude of skewness based on this summary only.\nThe amount of skewness is a bit subjective — so just discuss and make a determination about whether the difference between median and mean seems sizeable.\n\n# check the numeric summary for percent change in dominant arm strength\n# can you tell the direction of skewness?? does it seem very skewed??\n\n\n\n\nknitr::purl(input = 'lab2-descriptive.qmd',\n            output = 'lab2-descriptive.R')"

Graded questions will be largely data analytic and will correspond to specific marked learning outcomes; responses will be assessed as satisfactory (S) or needing improvement (NI) according to whether they are fully correct, and qualitative feedback will be offered if an assessment of NI is given. Ungraded questions are entirely for your benefit as extra practice. You can submit revisions to any graded responses needing improvement for reassessment.\nTests are your opportunity to demonstrate that you’ve synthesized course material and achieved learning outcomes. Tests will comprise sets of questions, some conceptual and some data analytic, corresponding to specific marked learning outcomes. Responses will be assessed as satisfactory (S) or needing improvement (NI) according to whether they are fully correct, and qualitative feedback will be offered if an assessment of NI is given. You will be given a 24 hour window to complete each test, and you can submit revisions to responses needing improvement.\nThe final oral exam will require you to find an application of course material in the field of your major and present it as a case study in 5 minutes. You will be expected to describe the research question, study design, analysis, and conclusion, and answer 1-2 questions. These will be carried out in private and scheduled during the final exam time. This assignment applies to learning outcome L11 only, and you will receive an assessment of ‘fully met’, ‘partly met’, or ‘unmet’ for that outcome depending on your presentation and ability to answer questions. A rubric will be provided in advance to clearly define the expectations associated with each possible assessment.\n\n\nLetter grades\nStudents will receive a score for each learning outcome representing the weighted proportion of questions matched with that outcome that received a satisfactory assessment across all assignments, with relatively more weight given to questions from tests. The outcome will be determined as ‘fully met’ if the weighted proportion is at least 0.8, ‘partly met’ if the weighted proportion is between 0.5 and 0.8, and ‘unmet’ otherwise. To receive a passing grade in the class, at least six outcomes must be partly met. Letter grades are then defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nMinimum number of partly + fully met outcomes\nMinimum number of fully met outcomes\n\n\n\n\nA\n10\n9\n\n\nA-\n10\n8\n\n\nB+\n8\n7\n\n\nB\n8\n6\n\n\nB-\n8\n5\n\n\nC+\n6\n5\n\n\nC\n6\n4\n\n\nC-\n6\n3\n\n\nD+\n6\n2\n\n\nD\n6\n1\n\n\nD-\n6\n0\n\n\n\nPlease note that these definitions are tentative and potentially subject to change. Please also note that failure to adhere to course policies — particularly collaboration, academic integrity, and attendance policies — may result in a lower letter grade than would otherwise be assigned.\n\n\nTentative schedule\nSubject to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTopics\nReadings (V&H)\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n1 (1/8/24)\nIntroduction to statistical thinking and study design\n1.1\nHW1\n\n\n2 (1/15/24)\nData, data types, and data collection\n1.2\nNone\n\n\n3 (1/22/24)\nFoundations for inference\n1.4 – 1.5; 4.1\nHW2\n\n\n4 (1/29/24)\nInterval estimation and hypothesis tests\n4.2 – 4.3\nTest 1\n\n\n5 (2/5/24)\nTwo-sample inference for numerical data; nonparametric alternatives\n5.1 — 5.3\nHW3\n\n\n6 (2/12/24)\nComparing means with analysis of variance\n5.4\nHW4\n\n\n7 (2/19/24)\nInference for categorical data: proportions\n8.1 — 8.2\nTest 2\n\n\n8 (2/26/24)\nInference for categorical data: chi-square tests\n8.3 — 8.4\nHW5\n\n\n9 (3/4/24)\nSimple linear regression: model framework and estimation\n6.1 — 6.3\nHW6\n\n\n10 (3/11/24)\nSimple linear regression: inference\n6.4 — 6.5\nTest 3\n\n\nFinals (3/18/24)\nN/A\nN/A\nOral exam\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse policies\n\nCollaboration\nCollaboration within the class and across class sections is allowed and encouraged on homework assignments, subject to certain conditions outlined in the paragraph below. Collaborations should not include individuals outside of the class. Students collaborating with a group are expected to prepare their own assignment submissions, in their own words and writing, and should to indicate their collaborators in writing on their submission. This is limited to peers that were consulted closely in completing the assignment; brief or passing interactions are not considered collaborations.\nA collaboration is a shared effort. Students that choose to work together on homework assignments are expected to make material contributions towards producing one or more shared answers or solutions. Material contributions might include participation in discussions, critique of a proposed solution, or presentation of a problem approach. In the absence of such contributions, submitting solutions prepared in a group is not appropriate. The best way to adhere to this policy is to attempt problems individually before consulting others and exchanging work.\n\n\nAttendance\nRegular attendance is essential for success in the course and required per University policy. Each student may miss two class meetings without notice but additional absences should be excusable and students should notify the instructor. Unexcused absences may negatively impact course grades.\n\n\nCommunication and email\nStudents are encouraged to use face-to-face means of communication (office hours, class meetings, appointments) when possible. Email may be used on a secondary basis or when a written record of communication is needed. Every effort is made to respond to email within 48 weekday hours — so a message sent Thursday or Friday may not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday. Time-sensitive messages should be identified as such in the subject line. For non-time-sensitive messages, please wait one week before sending a reminder.\n\n\nTime commitment\nSTAT218 is a four-credit course, which corresponds to a minimum time commitment of 12 hours per week, including lectures, reading, assignments, and study time. Some variability in workload by week should be expected, and most students will need to budget a few extra hours each week. However, students can expect to be able to meet course expectations with a time commitment of 12-16 hours per week. Considering that lecture accounts for four hours per week, students should anticipate devoting 8-12 hours outside of class.\n\n\nAssignment scores and final grades\nEvery effort will be made to provide consistent, fair, and accurate evaluation of student work. Students should notify the instructor of any suspected errors or discrepancies in evaluation promptly on an assignment-by-assignment basis (i.e., not at the end of the quarter) to guarantee consideration. Final (letter) grades will only be changed in the case of clerical errors. Attempting to negotiate scores or final grades is not appropriate.\nPer University policy, faculty have final responsibility for grading criteria and grading judgment and have the right to alter student assessment or other parts of the syllabus during the term. If any student feels their grade is unfairly assigned at the end of the course, they have the right to appeal it according to the procedure outlined here.\n\n\nDeadlines and late work\nEach student may turn in two homework assignments up to one week late without penalty at any time during the quarter and without notice. Subsequently, late work will incur a penalty in final grade calculations unless an extension is granted in advance. As a general policy, late work will be not accepted beyond one week after the original due date. Deadlines for tests are strict.\nThese policies are intended to provide you with some flexibility to work around unforeseen circumstances while maintaining accountability for completing coursework in a timely manner. That said, if any circumstances arise that the policies do not accommodate well, please let me know and I will do my best to work with you to keep you on track in the course. Exceptions may be granted for significant and unforeseen challenges (medical absences, family emergencies, and the like).\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Accommodation requests should be made through the Disability Resource Center (DRC).\n\n\nConduct and Academic Integrity\nStudents are expected to be aware of and adhere to University policy regarding academic integrity and conduct. Detailed information on these policies, and potential repercussions of policy violations, can be found via the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities (OSRR).\nInstances of academic dishonesty will be reported to OSRR and will result in penalty ranging from credit reduction to grade reduction to course failure, depending on the severity of the situation.\n\n\nCopyright and distribution of course materials\nAll course materials, including handouts, homework assignments, lab assignments, study guides, course notes, exams, and solutions are subject to copyright; students are not permitted to share or distribute any course materials without the written consent of the instructor. This includes, in particular, uploading materials or prepared solutions to online services and sharing materials or prepared solutions with students who may take the course in a future term. Transgressions of this policy compromise the effectiveness of instruction and assessment and do a disservice to current and future students."
