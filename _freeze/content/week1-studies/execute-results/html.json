All materials are hosted/linked on the course website. I *won't* be using Canvas.\n\n**Textbook**. Vu and Harrington (2020). [Introdutory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences](https://www.openintro.org/book/biostat/). I suggest a $5-15 donation.\n\n**Statistical software**. R/RStudio hosted online via posit.cloud workspace. You will need to create an account and purchase a $5/month student subscription.\n\n## Class meetings\n\nClass meetings will usually consist of a reading quiz, a lecture, a break, and a lab.\n\n**Preparing for class meetings:**\n\n1.   Check the course website for posted reading, materials, and assignments.\n2.   Complete readings *in advance* of the class meetings for which they are listed. \n3. Write down one question you have about the reading and bring it to class.\n4.   Download and/or print a copy of the posted course notes (slides) for you to annotate and bring them to class.\n\n## Assignments\n\nYou will have three categories of assignments:\n\n- **homework** problems: two per class due by next class\n- **tests**: every 2-3 weeks, distributed Wednesday, due Friday\n- a **project**: find and present a case study\n\nDeadline policies:\n\n- one-hour grace period on all deadlines\n- four homework problem sets can be turned in up to 48 hours late without notice\n- besides free lates, extensions must be arranged 24 hours in advance of the deadline\n\n## Grades\n\nEvery graded question/problem is matched to one or more of the 11 course learning outcomes.\n\n- Questions/problems are evaluated as satisfactory (S), needs improvement (NI), or missing (M).\n\n- For each outcome, the percentage of questions/problems awarded a satisfactory mark is used to determine whether that outcome is fully met, partly met, or not met:\n\n    + fully met: 80% or more of matched questions satisfactory\n    + partly met: 50% -- 80% of matched questions satisfactory\n    + not met: less than 50% of matched questions satisfactory\n\nYour course grade is based on how many learning outcomes are fully met. To pass, you must partly or fully meet at least 6 outcomes; for a C-, you must fully meet at least 3 outcomes.\n\n## Important policies\n\n- extensions must be confirmed (not simply requested) 24 hours in advance\n- collaboration on homework is encouraged, but everyone involved needs to...\n  \n    + make a contribution\n    + write up their own work\n    \n- submitting AI-generated content in place of your own work is not acceptable\n\n    + responsible use is okay, but not recommended (GPT outputs are misleading)\n    + penalties for AI plagiarism depend on precedent and severity\n\n Minor offense | Major offense | Penalty\n---|---|---\nFirst |  | loss of credit and warning\nSecond | First | loss of credit and OSRR report\nThird | Second | course failure and second OSRR report\n\n# Study design\n\n## What is a study?\n\nA **study** is an effort to collect data in order to answer one or more research questions.\n\n-   studies must be well-matched to research questions to provide good answers\n\n-   how data are obtained is just as important as how the resulting data are analyzed\n\n-   no analysis, no matter how sophisticated will rescue a poorly conceived study\n\nA **study unit** is the smallest object or entity that is measured in a study; also called *experimental unit* or *observational unit.*\n\n## Two types of studies\n\n**Observational studies** collect data from an existing situation without intervention.\n\n-   Aim is to detect associations and patterns\n\n-   Can't be used to establish causal links\n\n**Experiments** collect data from a situation in which one or more interventions have been introduced by the investigator.\n\n-   Aim is to draw conclusions about the causal effect of interventions\n-   Stronger form of scientific evidence than an observational study\n\nOften, observational studies are used to explore/generate hypotheses prior to designing an experiment.\n\n## Comparing study types\n\nEither type of study can be used to address a question.\n\n| Question                                          | Observational study                                                      | Experiment                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Are diet and mood related?                        | Conduct surveys on diet, lifestyle, and affect                           | Recruit study participants, assign diets, measure affect                                     |\n| Is vaping safer than smoking?                     | Follow groups of vapers and smokers over time and record health outcomes | Among a group of smokers, assign some to switch to vaping; compare health outcomes over time |\n| Do insecticide applications affect soil microbes? | Analyze soil samples from farms using different insecticides             | \\[**Your turn**\\]                                                                            |\n\nCan you think of pros and cons for each study type?\n\n## Why does intervention matter?\n\nControl over conditions allows a researcher to study causal effects resulting from interventions. This is not possible in observational studies due to the potential for **confounding**.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nConfounding: an unobserved condition is associated with both the study condition and the outcome.\n\n- Failure to measure and account for confounders potentially distorts observed associations\n- Example: a study finds that dog owners live longer, but doesn't measure exercise; so it might just be the daily walks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n  A(unobserved variable) --- B(study variable) & C(study outcome) \n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is very common in observational studies, because you can't measure every study condition.\n\n## Antidote: randomization\n\nThe ability to control study conditions allows researchers to randomly allocate interventions among study subjects.\n\n::: columns\n**Randomization eliminates confounding** by isolating the condition(s) of interest:\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   interventions are independent of extraneous conditions ⟹ no association possible\n\n-   if outcomes differ systematically according to the intervention, you can be certain that it is not an artifact\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n  A(unobserved condition) x-.-x B(study condition)\n  A --- C(outcome)\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Practical consequences\n\nThe ability to randomize interventions in experiments means:\n\n-   observed associations are independent of extraneous factors\n\n-   results can support causal inferences\n\nThe absence of randomization in observational studies means:\n\n-   confounding is always possible\n\n-   results may be misleading\n\n## Experimental designs\n\nA **treatment** is an experimental intervention; the **design** of an experiment refers to how treatments are allocated to study units.\n\nThe most basic design is:\n\n-   \\[balanced\\] each treatment is replicated an equal number of times\n\n-   \\[randomized\\] treatments are allocated completely at random to study units\n\n-   \\[no crossover\\] each study unit receives exactly one treatment\n\nWe'll call this a **completely randomized design**. It's the only kind of experimental design we're going to consider in STAT218.\n\nThere are many other designs that we won't discuss (but see STAT313); these are all about improving experimental efficiency by controlling extraneous variation.\n\n## Data collection\n\nStudy units should be chosen so as to represent a larger collection.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/srs.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nA study **population** is a collection of all study units of interest.\n\nA **sample** is a subcollection from a population:\n\n-   *random* if study units have a known chance of inclusion in the sample\n-   *nonrandom* or *convenience* otherwise\n:::\n:::\n\nThe gold standard is the **simple random sample**: each study unit in the population has an equal chance of inclusion in the sample.\n\n## LEAP Study\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nLearning early about peanut allergy (LEAP) study:\n\n-   640 infants in UK with eczema or egg allergy but no peanut allergy enrolled\n\n-   each infant randomly assigned to peanut consumption and peanut avoidance groups\n\n    -   peanut consumption: fed 6g peanut protein daily until 5 years old\n\n    -   peanut avoidance: no peanut consumption until 5 years old\n\n-   at 5 years old, oral food challenge (OFC) allergy test administered\n\n-   13.3% of the avoidance group developed allergies, compared with 1.9% of the consumption group\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Study characteristics\n\n**Study type:** experiment\n\n**Study population:** UK infants with eczema or egg allergy but no peanut allergy\n\n**Sample:** 640 infants from population\n\n**Study design:** completely randomized design\n\n**Treatments:** peanut consumption; peanut avoidance\n\n**Study outcome:** development of peanut allergy by 5 years of age\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n## Study results\nModerated peanut consumption causes a reduction in the likelihood of developing an allergy.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n## Checklist for next time\n\n1.
