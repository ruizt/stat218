You can call me Trevor, or, if you prefer, Dr. Ruiz.\n\n-   Born in Oregon, grew up in Maryland\n-   BA Philosophy, MS & PhD Statistics\n-   Research interests: methods for large and complex scientific data\n-   Hobbies: juggling, dance, classical guitar\n-   Have a cat named Mona\n\n## Why am I a statistician?\n\nShort answer: I like variety.\n\nLong answer:\n\n-   as a philosophy student I was interested in how we support claims of empirical fact through scientific investigation\n\n-   usually involves data as quantitative evidence\n\n-   statistics is the science of evaluating quantitative evidence\n\nSilly answer: I couldn't come up with anything better to do.\n\n## About you\n\nBy the numbers...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week1-welcome_files/figure-revealjs/class info-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## About you\n\nBy show of hands...\n\n::: incremental\n1.  First statistics class ever?\n2.  Last statistics class you expect to take?\n3.  Yes to 1 and 2?\n4.  Expect to use statistics for your degree coursework?\n5.  Expect to use statistics for research or senior project?\n6.  Required for your major?\n7.  Considering a statistics or data science minor?\n:::\n\n## Uncertainty {.smaller}\n\nLife is full of uncertainty, and this can make a lot of questions hard to answer:\n\n1.  Imagine you're a medical care provider. Which therapy should you prescribe for a patient given their prognosis? You don't know precisely how each one will turn out, so how do you decide?\n2.  Flu shots don't always prevent people from getting the flu; many people who are innoculated still become ill, sometimes fatally. Your doctor asks if you want the shot. Should you get it?\n3.  You're a trainer devising a fitness regimen for a client. You've decided on the basic elements, but what order should you recommend? Will it make any difference with respect to their goals? How will you know?\n4.  You're considering trying a nutritional supplement for weight loss. Some people that try it experience severe side effects, but not too many. So, is it safe? It works sometimes, but not all the time. So, is it effective?\n\n## Statistics and uncertainty\n\n*Key problem: similar situations do not always result in the same outcome.*\n\nStatistical thinking: **uncertainty is measurable**.\n\nWhat statistics can offer:\n\n-   principles for designing studies and collecting data in order to capture outcome variability\n-   data analytic tools to distinguish random from systematic variability\n-   heuristics to make inferences that account for uncertainty\n\n## Course goal and scope\n\nThe overarching goal of 218 is to introduce you to statistics in a hands-on way that is relevant to your major.\n\nSo we will focus on:\n\n-   statistical thinking, study design, and data analysis\n-   classical methods, mostly developed 1900-1940\n-   case studies from life sciences\n-   application, not theory\n\n## Materials {.smaller}\n\n**Web**. All materials are hosted/linked on the course website. I *won't* be using Canvas.\n\n**Books**. Readings will be assigned from three textbooks, all available at no cost:\n\n-   Vu and Harrington (2020).

not allowed on tests\n\n-   attendance expected; more than two unexcused absences may negatively impact grade\n\n-   expect to allocate 12-16hr/wk, including class meetings\n\n-   two free late assignment submissions, anytime and without notice, up to one week from deadline\n\n## Office hours & email\n\nOffice hours are 12-2 M-W in 25-236\n\n-   Schedule 10min time slots via Calendly (see syllabus for link)\n\nUsually I get to email quickly, but allow at least 48 (weekday) hours\n\n-   If you haven't heard back in a week, that means I missed it — send me a reminder!\n\n## Working groups\n\nFor labs and in class activities, you'll work in groups. Let's form those now.\n\nIcebreakers:\n\n-   Name, major, class standing\n\n-   Hometown\n\n-   One personal interest\n\n## Introduction to posit.cloud\n\nYou'll be learning some basics in R in this class. It's not a programming class, so the goal is to learn simply to implement the methods we're covering.\n\nWhy R?\n\n-   Free\n\n-   Open source — rapid development for new methods\n\n-   Widely used\n\nLet's take some time to introduce this environment.\n\nGo to: course webpage \\> syllabus \\> materials. Then look for:\n\n![](img/posit-link.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nTake a moment to create an account.\n\n## An example project\n\n![](img/posit-landing.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n1.  Make sure the class workspace \"stat218\" is highlighted at left. If \"Your Workspace\" is highlighted, you won't see the example assignment.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n2.  Click on the example assignment, then wait.\n\nOnce everyone is ready, we'll have a look at the example files together.\n\n## Orientation checklist\n\n1.  Overall layout of RStudio: file navigator, console, file editor.\n2.  `README.md` — keep this open for reference as we go.\n    -   As an aside: whenever you see a file called README, you should read it.\n3.  `example-script.R` is an R script\n    -   how to execute lines of code\n    -   data import on L18\n    -   make and save changes\n4.  `example-doc.qmd` is a quarto doc\n    -   YAML header\n    -   how to render\n    -   make and save changes\n5.  Files you should ignore\n\n## For next time\n\nYou'll read about study designs. As you're reading...\n\nConsider: there is broad agreement that smoking causes cancer, but not all smokers develop cancer.\n\n1.  What then do we mean by \"cause\" when we say that smoking causes cancer?\n2.  What do you imagine the evidence might be for this claim?\n3.  How would you design a study to test the hypothesis that smoking causes cancer? \n    - Which of the designs mentioned in the reading seem potentially applicable?\n    - Pick one design that seems best suited to the question. If you were to carry out a study according to that design, what would constitute evidence for or against the hypothesis?\n",
