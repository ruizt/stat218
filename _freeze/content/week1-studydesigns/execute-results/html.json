What are the pros and cons?\n\n## Why does intervention matter?\n\nIn an experiment, the researcher intentionally intervenes in a way that they expect to change outcomes.\n\n-   **intervention** confers a degree of **control** over study conditions\n\n<!-- -   by controlling study conditions so that interventions are the only source of systematic variation in outcomes, one can study the **causal effects** of intervention -->\n\nIn an observational study, there is no (intentional) intervention.\n\n-   **without intervention** the researcher has **no control** over study conditions\n\n<!-- -   outcomes may vary due to conditions not measured in the study, so **no causal effects** can be observed with certainty -->\n\nControl over conditions allows a researcher to study causal effects resulting from interventions. This can best be understood in terms of a phenomenon known as *confounding*.\n\n## Confounding\n\nConfounding occurs when two conditions cannot be differentiated.\n\nThis happens when either:\n\n-   \\[omission\\] one study condition is not measured\n\n    -   a researcher finds that dog owners live longer, but failed to measure how much exercise each subject gets\n\n    -   is it the dog, or the daily walks?\n\n-   \\[conflation\\] two study conditions are *always* observed simultaneously\n\n    -   a researcher finds that people on diet 1 tend to be overweight, but all study participants on diet 1 are from the U.S., and all study participants on diet 2 are from Canada\n\n    -   is it the diet, or the country?\n\n## Consequences of confounding\n\nUsually, researchers are concerned with confounding by omission.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"0.4\"}\nWhen an unobserved condition is associated with both the observed condition and the outcome one may observe:\n\n-   an artificial association between the study condition and outcome\n\n-   a distorted association between the study condition and outcome\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"0.6\"}\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n  A(unobserved condition) --- B(study condition) & C(outcome) \n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is very common in observational studies, because you can't measure every study condition.\n\n## Example of confounding\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week1-studydesigns_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   \\[left\\] Higher state educational expenditure looks associated with *lower* SAT scores\n\n-   \\[center\\] But increased expenditure looks associated with more test takers\n\n-   \\[right\\] And higher percentages of test takers are associated with lower averages\n\n*If you ignored how many students take the test, you'd conclude that expenditure is counterproductive*\n\n## Antidote: randomization\n\nThe ability to control study conditions allows researchers to *randomize* interventions among study subjects:\n\n-   allocated in such a way that all subjects are equally likely to receive any intervention\n\n::: columns\n**Randomization eliminates confounding** by isolating the condition(s) of interest:\n\n::: {.column width=\"0.6\"}\n-   interventions are independent of extraneous conditions ⟹ no association possible\n\n-   if outcomes differ systematically according to the intervention, you can be certain that it is not an artifact\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"0.4\"}\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n  A(unobserved condition) x-.-x B(study condition)\n  A --- C(outcome)\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\nExtraneous conditions *may* still be associated with outcomes and add noise — well-thought-out experiments find ways to reduce this.\n\n<!-- ## Confounding in experiments -->\n\n<!-- *Caveat: randomized experiments are not immune from confounding.* -->\n\n<!-- Consider a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation aids. -->\n\n<!-- |                   | Varenicline | Bupropion   | Placebo     | -->\n\n<!-- |-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------| -->\n\n<!-- | Group size        | 352         | 329         | 344         | -->\n\n<!-- | Completed therapy | 259 (73.6%) | 225 (68.4%) | 215 (62.5%) | -->\n\n<!-- If the results are analyzed based only on participants that completed the therapy, confounding could distort results: -->\n\n<!-- -   underlying differences among participants may be associated with both persistence and success -->\n\n## Practical consequences\n\nThe ability to randomize interventions in experiments means:\n\n-   observed associations are independent of extraneous factors\n\n-   results can support causal inferences\n\nThe absence of randomization in observational studies means:\n\n-   confounding is always possible\n\n-   results may be misleading\n\nUsually, *observational studies are considered weaker forms of scientific evidence than experiments*, with some caveats:\n\n-   a large volume of independent observational studies pointing to the same conclusions may be more convincing than a few narrow experiments\n\n-   observational studies may provide better evidence under real world conditions than available experimental data\n\n## Common study designs\n\nStudies can be designed to investigate outcomes in a variety of ways, regardless of whether study conditions include intervention. Many study designs originate in clinical medicine — the following are among the most common.\n\n-   In **prospective** studies participants are recruited *before* developing a condition\n\n-   In **retrospective** studies participants are recruited *after* developing a condition\n\n-   A **cohort** study involves people belonging to a group defined by one or more (usually artificial) criteria\n\n-   In a **case-control** study, participants with (cases) and without (controls) a condition are compared\n\n-   In a **matched case-control** study, cases and controls are paired according to criteria determined by the investigator\n\n## Study designs can get complicated\n\nThe study designs mentioned previously are not mutually exclusive and could apply to either experiments or observational studies. For example:\n\n-   following this year's Cal Poly freshmen (cohort) until graduation (condition) and comparing four-year graduation (outcome) rates between those that participated in a new orientation activity (cases) and those that didn't (controls) would be a *prospective case-control cohort study*\n\n-   it would be an observational study if participation was voluntary, and an experiment if students were assigned to participate or not\n\nCan you change the example so that...\n\n-   it's a retrospective study?\n\n-   it's a *matched* case-control study?\n\n## Experimental designs\n\nA **treatment** is an experimental intervention; the **design** of an experiment refers to how treatments are allocated to study units.\n\nThe most basic design is:\n\n-   \\[balanced\\] each treatment is replicated an equal number of times\n\n-   \\[randomized\\] treatments are allocated completely at random to study units\n\n-   \\[no crossover\\] each study unit receives exactly one treatment\n\nWe'll call this a **completely randomized design**. It's the only kind of experimental design we're going to consider in STAT218.\n\nThere are many other designs that we won't discuss (but see STAT313); these are all about improving experimental efficiency by controlling extraneous variation.\n\n## Blinding\n\nThe terms *single-blind* and *double-blind* refer to experiments with human subjects, typically in clinical studies.\n\nIn a **single-blind** study, participants are unaware of which treatment they receive.\n\n-   Example: in a case-control study, one group of patients is given a new medicine and the other is given a saline solution administered under identical conditions\n-   Idea: controls for placebo effect\n\nIn a **double-blind** study, both participants *and* investigators are unaware of which treatments are administered.\n\n-   Example: same as above, but now the person administering the doses is unaware of which are medicine and which are saline\n-   Idea: controls for unconscious influence on outcome by researchers (*e.g.,* attend more carefully and compassionately to patients receiving medicine out of concern for side-effects)\n\n## Data collection\n\nWe will discuss data collection in more depth later, but the way that study units are obtained, independently of the type of study or design, determines the breadth of conclusions supported by the results, depending on whether study units chosen are representative of a larger collection.\n\nThe gold standard is a *simple random sample* of units selected from a larger collection:\n\n-   every unit in the larger collection has an equal chance of being selected\n\n-   easier said than done --- failure to obtain a random sample is one of the most common study flaws\n\nFor now we will set the issue of sampling aside.\n\n## Considerations in creating a study\n\n-   The research question should be motivated by science, not statistics.\n\n-   You may have to work within limitations:\n\n    -   The design that best aligns with the question may not be possible or practical.\n\n    -   An experiment might give the strongest evidence but not be feasible or ethical.\n\n-   A plan should be in place for *all* of the following:\n\n    -   how to obtain/recruit study units/participants\n\n    -   how many to obtain/recruit and how to ensure that target is met\n\n    -   protocol for allocating treatment\n\n    -   collecting data and measuring outcomes\n\n    -   contingencies for dropout/failure to ensure the study yields results\n\n    -   data handling and data analysis\n\n    -   how results will be used\n\n## Study design in STAT218\n\nIn STAT218 you are expected to be fluent with study design concepts, but of course won't actually carry out an end-to-end study.\n\n-   \\[L1\\] design a data collection scheme based on simple random sampling or simple experimental designs\n\n-   \\[L2\\] distinguish between observational studies and experiments and understand the limitations (practical and consequential) of each\n\n## Case study: LEAP\n\nLearning early about peanut allergy (LEAP) study:\n\n-   640 infants in UK with eczema, egg allergy, or both enrolled; 530 passed a skin test showing no peanut allergy\n\n-   each infant randomly assigned to peanut consumption and peanut avoidance groups\n\n    -   peanut consumption: fed 6g peanut protein daily until 5 years old\n\n    -   peanut avoidance: no peanut consumption until 5 years old\n\n-   at 5 years old, oral food challenge (OFC) allergy test administered\n\n    -   PASS: no allergy detected\n\n    -   FAIL: allergy detected\n\n*What kind of study is this? Experiment or observational study? Retrospective, prospective, case-control, cohort?*\n\n## Case study: LEAP\n\n![Tabular summary of LEAP results.](img/leap-1.png){width=\"300\"}\n\n-   Does peanut avoidance/consumption appear associated with developing an allergy?\n\n-   If so, does the study provide evidence that early exposure likely reduces the chance of developing an allergy by 5 years of age?\n\n-   What calculation could you perform to summarize the difference between study groups?\n",
