## Example 2.1 Claims of Numbness After Automobile Accident

A 28-year-old developed pain involving the spine and the left side of her body after an automobile collision. They were actively involved in a personal litigation against the company that owned the other vehicle, and they reported constant pain and numbness in the left arm. To test their claims, researchers touched their left arm with either 1 finger or 2 fingers simultaneously while their eyes were closed. The word "touch" was said simultaneously with the presentation of the tactile stimulus so that the subject knew when to respond. She then had to indicate whether she felt 1 single touch or 2 simultaneous touches (with the double-touch stimulus, the fingertips were always spaced 2 inches apart). The subject received 100 stimuli overall; they were correct on 30 of them. Is there statistical evidence that they are intentionally answering incorrectly?

1.  Identify both the population and sample of interest.

<span style="color:blue;">Population: all possible stimuli trials that could have been given to the 28-year old</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Sample: n = 100 stimuli the 28 year-old received</span>

2.  Identify the single categorical variable of interest.

<span style="color:blue;">Outcome (Correctly identified the touch/Incorrectly identified the touch)</span>

3.  Identify both the parameter and statistic of interest.

<span style="color:blue;">Parameter: the proportion of all possible stimuli trials the 28 year old would answer correctly. </span>

<span style="color:blue;">Statistic: $\hat p = 30/100 = 0.3$ </span>

4.  Carry out the formal hypothesis test to address the research question.

+ Hypotheses:

\vspace{0.15in}

<span style="color:blue;">Wording based on research question -</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Null: The 28 year-old is just guessing for all possible stimuli.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Alternative: The 28 year-old is intentionally answering incorrectly for for all possible stimuli.</span>

\vspace{0.15in}

<span style="color:blue;">Wording based on parameter -</span>


<span style="color:blue;">Null: the proportion of all possible stimuli trials the 28 year old would answer correctly is equal to 0.5.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Alternative: the proportion of all possible stimuli trials the 28 year old would answer correctly is greater than 0.5.</span>

\vspace{0.15in}

<span style="color:blue;">Using symbols -</span>

<span style="color:blue;">$H_0: \pi = 0.5$</span>

<span style="color:blue;">$H_A: \pi > 0.5$</span>

+ Estimate p-value (Carry out the simulation study to investigate this p-value, sketch or paste your simulation results here)

\hfill Use the simulation results to estimate the p-value: <span style="color:blue;"><0.001 (note that when we never have a simulation set as extreme or more extreme than what we observed, the p-value is "0", very very small!)</span>
  
+ Conclusion:

<span style="color:blue;">We have strong evidence to conclude the 28 year-old is intentionally answering incorrectly for for all possible stimuli (p-value < 0 .0001 ).</span>

## Example 2.2: Effectiveness of an Experimental Drug

Suppose a commonly prescribed drug for relieving nervous tension is believed to be only 70% effective. Experimental results with a *new* drug administered to a random sample of 20 adults who were suffering from nervous tension show that 18 received relief. Is there statistical evidence that the new experimental drug is more than 70% effective?

1.  Identify both the population and sample of interest.

<span style="color:blue;">Population: all adults suffering from nervous tension</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Sample: n = 20 adults who received the new drug for nervous tension</span>

2.  Identify the single categorical variable of interest.

<span style="color:blue;">Relief (yes/no)</span>

3.  Identify both the parameter and statistic of interest.

<span style="color:blue;">Parameter: the proportion of all adults who receive relief from nervous tension</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Statistic: $\hat p = 18/20 = 0.9$n</span>


4.  Carry out the formal hypothesis test to address the research question.

+ **Research Question** Is there statistical evidence that the new drug is more than 70% effective?

\vspace{0.15in}

+ Hypotheses:

<span style="color:blue;">In words:</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Null: the proportion of all adults who receive relief from nervous tension is equal to 0.7.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Alternative: the proportion of all adults who receive relief from nervous tension is greater than 0.7.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">In symbols:</span>

<span style="color:blue;">$H_0: \pi = 0.7$</span>

<span style="color:blue;">$H_A: \pi > 0.7$</span>

+ Estimate p-value (Carry out the simulation study to investigate this p-value, sketch or paste your simulation results here)

```{r}
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("02-images/example-2.2-sim.png")
```

\hfill Use the simulation results to estimate the p-value: <span style="color:blue;">0.03</span>

  
+ Conclusion:

<span style="color:blue;">We have strong evidence to conclude the proportion of all adults who receive relief from nervous tension is greater than 0.7 (p-value = 0.03).</span>
