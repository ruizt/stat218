In this chapter, we will consider descriptive methods appropriate for summarizing numerical variables.  

## Example 5.1: IMDb Movie Reviews

A data set was collected on movies released in 2020. Here is a list of some of the variables collected on the observational units (each movie):

| **Variable**     | **Description**                                             |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Movie`          | Title of the movie                                          |
| `averageRating`  | Average IMDb user rating score from 1 to 10                 |
| `numVotes`       | Number of votes from IMDb users                             |
| `Genre`          | Categories the movie falls into (e.g., Action, Drama, etc.) |
| `2020 Gross`     | Gross profit from movie viewing                             |
| `runtimeMinutes` | Length of movie (in minutes)                                |
|                  |                                                             |

```{r data}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
movies <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/movies_2020.xlsx") |> 
  distinct(Movie, .keep_all = TRUE)

title_ids <- read_csv("data/movie_ids.csv")
  
movie_ids <- left_join(movies, 
                       title_ids, 
                       by = 
                         intersect(
                           colnames(movies), 
                           colnames(title_ids)
                           )
                       )

ratings <- read_csv("data/ratings.csv")

movie_ratings <- left_join(movie_ids, 
                           ratings, 
                           by = "id"
                           ) |>  
  select(Movie, 
         Genre, 
         `2020 Gross`, 
         runtimeMinutes, 
         averageRating, 
         numVotes) |>  
  drop_na(averageRating)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
head(movie_ratings)
```

1. What is the variable of interest? What is the data type?


\vspace{0.4in}

2. What is the observation?

\vspace{0.4in}

The `favstats` function from the `mosaic` package will provide us with key summary statistics for a numerical variable:

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(mosaic)
favstats(~ averageRating, data = movie_ratings)
```

Next, let’s discuss the summary statistics provided in each piece of the output:

::: callout-note
### Measures of location and variability

**Measures of location** These summaries give us an idea of where a data distribution lies.

+ **Mean** and **median** give us an idea of the center (or middle) of the distribution.
+ The percentiles (**Q1** and **Q3**) give us an idea of what percent of the data distribution lies at or below a particular value. 

What summary (or summaries) we choose to describe the entire data set depends on our objective. If the goal is to describe where a data distribution is centered, then the mean or median may be an appropriate summary statistic. However, if interest lies in what value is exceeded by only 5% of the data distribution, for example, then we would use the 95th percentile.  

\vspace{0.1in}

**Measures of variability** These summaries help us quantify how much the observations in a data set tend to vary from each other. 

+ The **sd** (standard deviation) is a measure of variability and quantifies how individual data points vary from the mean. 
+ The **IQR** (inner-quartile range) is the distance between Q1 and Q3 (the first and third quartiles).
:::

For example, compare and contrast the variability in the following distributions. The first is the actual data distribution of IMDB movie ratings; the second is a hypothetical data set created for purposes of comparison.  Which data set has more variability?  Why?

```{r dotplot-orig}
#| echo: false

#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.1, method="histodot") +
  labs(title = "Original Data Set", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```

```{r dotplot-simulated}

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
fake_data <- tibble(averageRating = c(rnorm(n = nrow(movie_ratings)-10, 
                                          mean = mean(movie_ratings$averageRating),
                                          sd = sd(movie_ratings$averageRating)/2
                                          ),
                                      runif(n = 10, 4, 5)
)
                    )
ggplot(data = fake_data, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.1, method="histodot") +
  labs(title = "Hypothetical Data Set", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis

## Graphical Summaries of Numerical Data

In this section, we will discuss common methods for graphing numerical data.  Graphs conveniently allow us to examine both the location and the variability in a data set.  Moreover, we gain insight into the shape of a data distribution.

### Dotplots

A dotplot will plot a dot for each value in the data set. The code below was used to create a dotplot of the
`averageRatings` variable from the movies data set. In a dotplot, the quantitative variable goes on the x-axis,
which is why the code says `x = averageRating` inside of the `aes()` function.

```{r dotplot-echo}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5, 
               method = "histodot") +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of ___________" # Label for y axis
       ) +
```

```{r dotplot-eval}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5, method="histodot") +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of ___________" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```

7. What does each dot on the dotplot represent?

### Histogram

A histogram is created by dividing the range of the data distribution into bins and then counting the number of observations that fall in each bin  A rectangular column is plotted in each interval, and the height of the column is proportional to the frequency of observations within the interval.  The y-axis can be labeled with either the count or the percentage of the observations that fall in each interval.

```{r dotplot-histo}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5, method="histodot") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 6.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 6.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 7.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 7.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 8.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 8.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 9.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```
\newpage

To create a histogram of the IMDb scores, all we need to do is change the geometric object we are displaying
on our plot! In a dotplot we use dots, but in a histogram we use bars. Notice, in the code below there are
two changes:

+ I am using `geom_histogram()` instead of `geom_dotplot()`
+ I am specifying how wide the bins of the histogram should be using `binwidth = 0.5`

```{r histogram-echo}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       )
```

```{r histogram}
#| warning: false
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "gray", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  # scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,10), breaks = seq(0,10,1), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```
4. Which range of IMDb scores have the *highest* frequency (number of movies)?

\vspace{0.2in}

5. What IMDB scores are movies *rarely* rated?

\vspace{0.2in}

6. Are there IMDB scores that were possible but no movies in this sample were given those ratings?

### Boxplot

The procedure for constructing a boxplot is as follows:

1.	Draw horizontal lines at Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (median / 50th percentile), and Q3 (75th percentile).  Enclose these horizontal lines in a box.
2.	Find the lower and upper whiskers:

+ The endpoint of the lower whisker is the larger of the minimum and (Q1 – 1.5*IQR).
+ The endpoint of the upper whisker is the smaller of the maximum and (Q3 + 1.5*IQR).

::: callout-note
### Outliers

Any measurement beyond the endpoint of either whisker is classified as a potential outlier (an extreme observation).

library(infer)
favstats(~ averageRating, data = movie_ratings)
```

:::: columns
::: column

**Bottom 6:**

```{r min}
movie_ratings |> 
  select(averageRating) |>  
  slice_min(order_by = averageRating, n = 6)
```

::: column

**Top 6:**

```{r max}
movie_ratings %>% 
  select(averageRating) |> 
  slice_max(order_by = averageRating, n = 6)
```

7. Using the summary statistics (same as we saw earlier) and top/bottom values of the data set provided, sketch a box plot of IMDb scores. *Hint: You will need to determine if there are any outliers.*

```{r}
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("05-images/boxplot.PNG")
```

8.	Are there any movies that are rated unusually low?  If so, which ones?

### A Discussion of Skewness

A data distribution is said to be symmetric if it has the same shape on both sides of the center. Skewness measures the amount of asymmetry in a data distribution.

The distribution is said to be skewed to the right if the measurements tend to trail off to the right.  Similarly, a distribution is skewed to the left if the measurements trail off to the left.

```{r}
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("05-images/skewed-sketc.PNG")
```


::: callout-note
## Describing distributions of quantitative variables

When describing distributions of quantitative variables we look at the **shape**, **center**, **spread**, and for **outliers**.

  + There are two measures of center: mean and the median
  + There are two measures of spread: standard deviation and the interquartile range, IQR = Q3 − Q1.
:::

10. Compare the three graphs of IMDb scores created above.

+ Which graph(s) show the shape of the distribution?

\vspace{0.2in}

+ Which graph(s) show the outliers of the distribution?

\vspace{0.2in}

+ Which graph plots the raw data (individual observations)?

\vspace{0.2in}


## Z-SCORES

A *Z-score*, often called a standardized value, measures the number of standard deviations a single observation is away from the mean of the data distribution. The z-score can be used to transform observations to a dimensionless scale; in addition, it can be used to measure the position of an observation. Z-scores are calculated as shown below:

$$\text{Z-score} = \frac{\text{Observation - Mean}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}$$

Interpretation of Z-Scores:

+ As mentioned, the standardized values transform the data so that the data is placed on a standard, dimensionless scale that has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
+ If a Z-Score is negative, then the observation is that many standard deviations below the mean.
+ If the Z-Score is positive, then the observation is that many standard deviations above the mean.
+ If the Z-Score is 0, then the data value is the same as the mean.
+ If the Standard Deviation is 0, then the Z-Score is not defined and thus cannot be computed.

```{r}
movie_ratings |> 
  mutate(Zscore = (averageRating - mean(averageRating))/sd(averageRating)) |> 
  select(Movie, averageRating, Zscore) |> 
  head()
```

11.	Show how the Z-score for "Halloween" was calculated:

12.	What does this tell you about the relative position of "Halloween" in the data set?

 \vspace{0.5in}
 
13.	Show how the Z-score for "The Call of the Wild" was calculated:

 \vspace{0.5in}

14.	What does this tell you about the relative position of "The Call of the Wild" in the data set?

 \vspace{0.5in}
 
## The Identification of Outliers

We have already discussed using boxplots to identify outliers.  In addition, we can use Z-scores.

+ Any data value whose Z-Score is below −2 or above 2 is considered a potential outlier.  
+ Any data value whose Z-Score is below -3 or above 3 is considered an outlier and warrants further investigation.

These guidelines come from the Empirical Rule: If the probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric, then the Empirical Rule applies.  This rule says that APPROXIMATELY…

+ 68% of the data values fall within one standard deviation of the mean.
+ 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
+ 99.7% of the data values fall within three standard deviations of the mean.
