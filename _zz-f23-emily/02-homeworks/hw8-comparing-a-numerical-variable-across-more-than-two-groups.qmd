Researchers set out to explore how squirrel size is impacted by latitude. Specifically, focusing on the lengths (in mm) observed in four distinct California locations: Big Bear, Hemet, Susanville, and Loop Hill. As these agile creatures navigate different environments, their lengths become a fascinating avenue for investigation, offering insights into potential ecological variations and adaptation strategies. Understanding the nuances in squirrel lengths across diverse locations not only contributes to our knowledge of local fauna but also has broader implications for ecosystem dynamics and the impact of environmental factors on wildlife morphology.

```{r}
head(squirrels)
```

**Research question** Does the mean length of all squirrels differ between the four selected California locations?

```{r}
favstats(Length ~ Location, data = squirrels)
```

```{r histogram}
#| fig-height: 8
#| fig-width: 6
ggplot(data = squirrels,
       mapping = aes(x = Length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~Location, ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "Comparing Squirrel Length",
       x = "Length (mm)",
       y = "Number of Squirrels")
```

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(data = squirrels,
       mapping = aes(x = Length,
                     y = Location)
       ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Comparing Squirrel Length",
       x = "Length (mm)",
       y = "California Location")
```

1. Identify the variables (levels/units) and data type.

2. Is this an experimental study or observational study? Explain.

\vspace{0.5in}

3. Discuss the visual comparison of the the four California locations. Which location appears to have a higher average squirrel length? The smallest? Do you think you will find evidence of a discernible difference in length between locations?

\vspace{0.5in}

4. Identify the observed mean, standard deviation, and sample size of each Location in the study. make sure to assign appropriate symbols.

\vspace{1.5in}

5. State the parameters in words with symbols (hint: there should be 4 of them).

\vspace{1.5in}

7. Write the null and alternative hypotheses using the appropriate mathematical symbols.

8. Check the assumptions necessary to conduct an ANOVA F-test.

\vspace{1.5in}

9. The following R code conducts an ANOVA F-test on the data. I have intentionally removed the degrees of freedom, mean square values, and statistic. Show how to determine / calculate these values using the information provided. Make sure to indicate what each value represents (e.g., df1, MSE, F-statistic, etc.).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
squirrel_model <- aov(Length ~ Location,
    data = squirrels
    )

squirrel_model |> 
  tidy()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
squirrel_model <- aov(Length ~ Location,
    data = squirrels
    )

squirrel_model |> 
  tidy() |> 
  mutate(df = c("A", "B"),
         meansq = c("C", "D"),
         statistic = c("E", NA))
```

10. Using the F-distribution below, show how you would calculate/estimate the p-value.

```{r}
#| echo: false

11.	Using the output above and an $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level, write a conclusion in the context of the problem.

12. What type of error could have been made? Explain.

> Type I \hspace{1in} Type II

\vspace{0.1in}

12.	The code below shows the pairwise comparisons with *no multiplicity* adjustment. At an $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level, which locations indicate a discernible difference in mean squirrel length?

```{r}
emmeans(squirrel_model,
        specs = ~ Location) |> 
  pairs(adjust = "none")
```

\vspace{0.2in}

13.	The code below shows the pairwise comparisons with a *tukey* multiplicity adjustment. At an $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level, which locations indicate a discernible difference in mean squirrel length?

```{r}
emmeans(squirrel_model,
        specs = ~ Location) |> 
  pairs(adjust = "tukey")
```

\vspace{0.2in}

14. Compare your decisions/results in the previous two questions. How does including a multiplicity adjustment (e.g., Tukey's) impact the results?
