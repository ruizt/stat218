Homer's Iliad is an epic poem, compiled around 800 BCE, that describes several weeks of the last year of the 10-year siege of Troy (Ilion) by the Achaeans. The story centers on the rage of the great warrior Achilles. But it includes many details of injuries and outcomes, and is thus the oldest record of Greek medicine. The data report 146 recorded injuries for which both injury site and outcome are provided in the Iliad (Hutchinson, 2013). The top 6 rows of the recorded injuries is shown below:

```{r data}
#| include: true
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(infer)

set.seed(56156)
iliad <- read_csv("data/iliad.csv") |>  
  mutate(`Injury Site` = replace_na(`Injury Site`, "Unknown"), 
         `Injury Site` = if_else(`Injury Site` == "body", 
                                 "Body", 
                                 `Injury Site`),
         id = sample(1:n(), n()),
         Poem = "Homer's Iliad"
  ) |> 
  arrange(id) |> 
  select(Poem, `Injury Site`, Lethal) |> 
  rename(InjurySite = `Injury Site`)
head(iliad)
```

**Research Question:** Is the location of an injury associated with whether the injury was fatal?

1. Identify the explanatory and response variables in the context of this study.

\vspace{0.6in}

2. How would you describe the orientation of this bar plot? \hspace{0.1in} Filled \hspace{0.1in} Stacked \hspace{0.1in} Dodged

```{r}
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-pos: "H"
ggplot(data = iliad,
       mapping = aes(x = InjurySite,
                     fill = Lethal)
       ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Outcomes for character's injured in the Iliad",
       x = "Location of Injury",
       y = "Number of Characters")
```

\vspace{0.25in}

3. Based on the plot does there appear to be an association between the variables? Explain
your answer.

\vspace{0.8in}

We can summarize the recorded injuries in a contingency table:

```{r}
iliad |>   
  count(InjurySite, Lethal) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Lethal,
              values_from = n) |> 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

4.  Which injury location has the smallest number of observations?

\vspace{0.25in}

5.  Were there more fatal injuries or nonfatal injuries overall?

\vspace{0.25in}

6.  What proportion of body injuries were fatal?

$$\hat p_{\text{fatal|body}} =$$

\vspace{0.15in}

7. What proportion of limb injuries were fatal?

$$\hat p_{\text{fatal|limb}} =$$

\vspace{0.15in}

8. Set up the null and alternative hypotheses to test the research question.

\vspace{1in}


9. In the table below, fill in the *expected* counts. 

| Lethal   | Body | Head/neck | Limb | Unknown |
|----------|------|-----------|------|---------|
| Fatal    |      |           |      |         |
| Nonfatal |      |           |      |         |

\vspace{1in}

10. Use the observed and expected counts to compute the Chi-square test statistic.

$$X^2 =$$

\vspace{0.5in}

After running 100 simulations under the assumption the location of an injury is not associated with whether the injury was fatal, I obtained the following distribution.

```{r}
#| eval: true
library(infer)
set.seed(56156)
iliad |> 
  specify(response = Lethal, 
          explanatory = InjurySite) |>  
  hypothesise(null = "independence") |>  
  generate(reps = 100, type = "permute") |>  
  calculate(stat = "Chisq") |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5) +
  theme_test() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = " ", 
            x = "Simulated X-Squared Statistics", 
            y = "Number of Simulations (out of 100 reps)")
```

11. Use the simulated distribution of the Chi-square test statistic under the assumption location of an injury is not associated with whether the injury was fatal to estimate your p-value and make a decision about your null hypothesis.

\vspace{1in}

12. Is it appropriate to conduct a Chi-square Test using the Chi-square distribution to test our research question?

\vspace{1in}

13. How many degrees of freedom would the Chi-square distribution for our Test Statistic follow?

\vspace{0.25in}

14. Select the correct code/output for the Chi-square Test to investigate this question.

\vspace{0.25in}

a.
```{r}
#| echo: true
chisq_test(x = iliad,
           response = Lethal,
           explanatory = InjurySite)
```

b.
```{r}
#| echo: true
chisq_test(x = iliad,
           response = Lethal)
```

c.
```{r}
#| echo: true
chisq_test(x = iliad,
           response = Lethal,
           p = c("Fatal" = 0.84,
                 "Nonfatal" = 0.16
                 )
)
```

19. Write a solution and make sure to include the chi-square test statistic, degrees of freedom, the p-value, and a conclusion written in everyday language.

<!-- ## Scenario 2: -->

<!-- In a recent study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers gathered data on 6,705 children to investigate the potential relationship between a mother's exposure to cats during pregnancy and the occurrence of psychotic episodes in their children. The study included two groups: one consisting of 4,746 children whose mothers did not have cats while pregnant and another group of 1,959 children whose mothers did have cats during pregnancy. -->

<!-- Among the group of 4,746 children with no maternal cat exposure, 536 children experienced one or more psychotic episodes during the course of the study. In contrast, among the 1,959 children whose mothers had cats during pregnancy, 240 children had one or more psychotic episodes. -->

<!-- **Research Question:** Does the pyscychtic episode rate differs between children who's moms did have cats while pregnant and those who's moms did not? -->

<!-- 1.	Create a table of counts based on the data obtained in this study.  -->

<!-- 2.	Find the proportion of children who's moms did not have cats while pregnant that had one or more pscychtic episode.  -->

<!-- 3.	Find the proportion of children who's moms did have cats while pregnant that had one or more pscychtic episode.  -->

<!-- 4.  Sketch in the *filled* bar plot below. -->

<!-- 5. Do the data provide statistical evidence for the research question?  Select the correct code/output for the chi-square test to investigate this question. -->

<!-- a. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
<!-- chisq_test(x = ) -->
