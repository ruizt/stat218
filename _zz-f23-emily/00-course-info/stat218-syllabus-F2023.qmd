# Course Description

Stat 218 is designed to engage you in the statistical investigation process from developing a research question and data collection methods to analyzing and communicating results. This course introduces basic descriptive and inferential statistics using both traditional (normal-distribution) and simulation approaches including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing on proportions (one-sample, two-sample), means (one-sample, two-sample, paired, ANOVA), regression, and correlation. You will be exposed to numerous examples of real-world applications of statistics that are designed to help you develop a conceptual understanding of statistics.

**Prerequisites**

Entrance to STAT 218 requires at least one of the following be met:

+ Grade of C- or better in MATH 115
+ Grade of B or better in MATH 96
+ appropriate placement on the [Math Placement Exam](https://math.calpoly.edu/mape).

You should have familiarity with computers and technology (e.g., Internet browsing, word processing, opening/saving files, converting files to PDF format, sending and receiving e-mail, etc.).

# Learning Objectives

+ Calculate and interpret various descriptive statistics.
+ Identify and describe data collection methods based on simple random sampling or simple experimental designs.
+ Construct and interpret confidence intervals for a single mean, differences between means for independent and paired samples, a single proportion, and the difference between two proportions from independent samples.
+ Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for the difference in two independent sample means and two independent sample proportions, Chi-square goodness-of-fit, Chi-square test for independence, and ANOVA F-test for multiple means.
+ Describe relationships between two quantitative variables using simple linear regression.

# Course Tools

For each topic, you will be provided a set of *course notes* `r fontawesome::fa("book")` containing definitions, examples, and practice problems. We will work through each set of notes during class time (both as a large class and in groups). You are expected to either print `r fontawesome::fa("print")` or save `r fontawesome::fa("save")` the notes to your device and follow along, filling `r fontawesome::fa("pencil")` out your set of notes as we go.

Tools you will need for this course:

`r fontawesome::fa("calculator")` Calculator (needs to be able to do basic operations)

`r fontawesome::fa("computer")` Laptop/Chromebook/iPad Device

Online tools we will use in this course:

`r fontawesome::fa("dice")` Online Applets <https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/index2021.html>

`r fontawesome::fa("keyboard")` Posit Cloud for R/RStudio <https://posit.cloud>

### General Evaluation Criteria

In every assignment, discussion, and written component of this class, you are
expected to demonstrate that you are intellectually engaging with the material.
I will evaluate you based on this engagement, which means that technically
correct but low effort answers which do not demonstrate engagement or
understanding will receive no credit.

While this is not an English class, grammar and spelling are important, as is
your ability to communicate technical information in writing; both of these
criteria will be used in addition to assignment-specific rubrics to evaluate
your work.

## Assignment Breakdown

### Participation

Most of class time will be devoted to group and individual activities. Coming to class prepared to participate in these activities is vital for your success in the course. It will be left up to the discretion of the instructor whether an activity is given and graded as participation. You must be in class to receive credit for any grades under participation. There may be "exit tickets" given at the end of class for participation points, data collection or simulation activities during class, or in-class discussion through online tools. You can expect about 1-2 participation check days per week.

+ **2** participation grades will be dropped; think of these as "sick days".

::: callout-note
If you are feeling ill, please *do not come to class*. Instead, email me, do your best to fill out the course notes then check with a group member for their notes. Work on the weekly homework/lab assignment; then schedule an appointment with me to meet virtually.
:::

### Homework Assignments

Homework will be assigned weekly throughout the semester to provide you additional practice with the course content. Each homework assignment will be accompanied by a "homework quiz" taken on Canvas and graded for correctness; you may take the "homework quiz" twice and Canvas will keep the average of the two attempts. You will also turn in your completed homework assignment (pdf or word document) via Canvas to be checked for intellectual engagement.

+ Homework Assignments are due **Wednesdays at 11:59am**.

### R Lab Assignments

Every Thursday, you will meet with your classmates and instructor to work through that week’s Posit Cloud group lab. The lab will reinforce the ideas learned in the course notes and homework assignment, through the use of R to explore and analyze data.

+ Each group will turn in the lab (pdf or html file) to Canvas.
+ R Labs are due as a group on **Mondays at 11:59pm**.

::: callout-warning
If you are absent for completing the lab with your group, you must complete the lab individually or reach an agreed upon time to meet with your group to complete the lab together.

You should *not* just add a group member's name to the weekly lab if absent.
:::

### Unit Quizzes

Quizzes will be administered approximately biweekly to assess your progress in the course. These quizzes will be closed note and closed book. These quizzes will be announced in class and via Canvas at least two days in advance. Students are expected to **notify me prior** to class if unable to take the quiz during the scheduled time. See the use of "grace days" for quizzes in the late policy below.

+ When given, unit quizzes will most often be taken on **Friday's during class**.

### Exams

Exams are closed book and notes. You are expected to take exams at the scheduled
times. If this is impossible due to extreme circumstances (illness, death in the family,
previously scheduled activities vital to academic program), please **notify me prior** to
the examination.

You will not be required to use R/Posit Cloud for the exams, but you may be asked to fill in blanks, provided output for interpretation, or asked to select the appropriate code to complete a task.

## Final Project

There will be one project during the quarter, where you will be asked to apply the statistical concepts you have learned in the context of real data. More details will be provided during class.

## Late Policy

<!-- There are no extensions on any assignments (this includes Check-ins, Practice -->
<!-- Activities, Labs, and Challenges). -->

<!-- + Canvas will automatically input a 0% for missing assignments as an incentive -->
<!-- for you to still turn the assignment in with a penalty described below. -->

<!-- + Canvas will automatically apply a 10% grade deduction for each day past -->
<!-- the due date with a minimum grade of 50%.  -->
<!--   + *Take note that Canvas sees 12:01am as a new day. Again, "Don't Play the Lines."* -->

<!-- + Solutions to Practice Activities will be posted. Therefore, no Practice -->
<!-- Activities will be accepted after the solution has been posted. -->

<!-- If you find yourself with extenuating circumstances, please email me **prior** to the due date. You will typically have multiple days to complete assignments, make sure to plan ahead for any unforeseen circumstances. -->

We are living through a challenging time with unique, unusual circumstances. I do not want class deadlines to cause you extreme stress or anxiety. I offer **3 "grace days"** -- days to turn in the assignment late without a penalty. These can be used on the homework assignments, lab assignments (a single group member must be willing to use one of their grace days for the entire group), and quizzes (must contact me ahead of time to arrange an alternative; for quizzes, "grace days" are measured in business days), but not participation or exams. These "grace days" can be used all at once on a single assignment or used on separate assignments throughout the quarter. Simply add a comment on the assignment in Canvas **and** send me an email to let me know you how many "grace days" you want to use on the assignment.

After using up your "grace days", late work will be accepted with a 10% grade penalty for each day late (including weekends) with a minimum grade of 50%.

::: callout-warning
### Automatic Canvas Settings

Canvas is set up to automatically input 0% for missing assignments (as an incentive to go complete the assignment) and apply the 10% grade deduction policy. I will need to manually adjust your grade when you use your grace days so it is important for you to leave a note on your assignment and email me. You are responsible for double checking your grade.
:::

If you find yourself with extenuating circumstances beyond the defined late policy, please email me before the due date.

# Course Expectations

You will get out of this course what you put in. The following excerpt was taken
from Rob Jenkins’ article “Defining the Relationship” which was published in The
Chronicle of Higher Education (August 8, 2016). This accurately summarizes what
I expect of you in my classroom (and also what you should expect of me).

*“I’d like to be your partner. More than anything, I’d like for us to form a mutually beneficial alliance in this endeavor we call education.*

*I pledge to do my part. I will:*

+ *Stay abreast of the latest ideas in my field.* 
+ *Teach you what I believe you need to know; with all the enthusiasm I possess.*
+ *Invite your comments and questions and respond constructively.*
+ *Make myself available to you outside of class (within reason).*
+ *Evaluate your work carefully and return it promptly with feedback.* 
+ *Be as fair, respectful, and understanding as I can humanly be.*
+ *If you need help beyond the scope of this course, I will do my best to provide it or see that you get it.* 

*In return, I expect you to:*

+ *Show up for class each day or let me know (preferably in advance) if you have some good reason to be absent.* 
+ *Do your reading and other assignments outside of class and be prepared for each class meeting.*
+ *Focus during class on the work we’re doing and not on extraneous matters (like whoever or whatever is on your phone at the moment).* 
+ *Participate in class discussions.*
+ *Be respectful of your fellow students and their points of view.* 
+ *In short, I expect you to devote as much effort to learning as I devote to teaching.*

*What you get out of this relationship is that you’ll be better equipped to succeed in this and other college courses, work-related assignments, and life in general. What I get is a great deal of professional and personal satisfaction. Because I do really like you [all] and want the best for you.”*

# Learning Environment and Support

I am committed to creating a safe and inclusive learning environment where all
students feel respected and supported. If there are any ways I can improve the
classroom environment to make it more welcoming for you, please don't hesitate
to let me know.

If you have a disability and require accommodations to fully participate in the
course, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss how I can best support
you. I also encourage you to register with Cal Poly's Disability Resource Center
(Building 124, Room 119 or at 805-756-1395) to explore additional accommodations
that may be available to you.

If you are experiencing food insecurity, housing instability, or other
challenges that may impact your ability to succeed in this course, please refer
to the resources listed on Canvas under "Student Support Services at Cal Poly."
These resources provide a range of essential support services, including
emergency financial assistance, counseling, and academic support.

I am committed to working with you to ensure that you have the resources and
support you need to succeed in this course. Let's work together to create a
positive and inclusive learning environment for all students.

# Academic Integrity and Class Conduct

Academic integrity is a fundamental value of this course and of the university.
Simply put, I will not tolerate cheating, plagiarism, or any other form of
academic dishonesty.

Any incident of academic misconduct, including dishonesty, copying, or
plagiarism, will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.

Cheating will earn you a grade of 0 on the assignment and an overall grade
penalty of at least 10%. In circumstances of flagrant cheating, you may be given
a grade of F in the course.

It is important to note that paraphrasing or quoting another's work without
proper citation is a form of academic misconduct. This includes using Chat GPT,
which should only be used to generate ideas and not as a substitute for your own

# California Faculty Association

The California Faculty Association (the labor union of Lecturers, Professors, Coaches, Counselors, and Librarians across the 23 CSU campuses) is in a difficult contract dispute with California State University management. It is possible that we will call a strike or other work stoppage this term. I promise to promptly inform you of any schedule disruption. Our working conditions are your learning conditions; we seek to protect both. For further information go to [www.CFAbargaining.org](https://www.cfabargaining.org/).
