The accuracy of a census report for a city in southern California was questioned by some government officials. A random sample of 1,215 people living in the city was used to check the census report. The census results (expected probabilities) are given below:

|                   | Black | Asian | Anglo | Latino/Latina | Indigenous | All others |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Census Result** | 10%   | 3%    | 38%   | 41%           | 6%         | 2%         |

**Research question:** Do the counts obtained via the random sample call into question the accuracy of the census report?

1.  **Read in the data and call it `ca_sample`. Additionally, print the top 6 rows to inspect your data.**

```{r read-data}
________ <- read_csv("data/________.csv")
```

2.  **What is the observational unit for this study?**

    Answer goes here.

3.  **Create a summary table of the number of individuals in the sample who self-identified with each ethnic `origin`.**

```{r summary-table}

```

4.  **Using the skills you learned class last week, create a bar plot of the observed *proportions* of individuals in our sample who self-identified with each ethnic `origin`.**

```{r bar-plot}

```

5.  **Notice the ordering of origin categories. Why do you think "All others" is first and "Latino/Latina" is last in our list?**

    Answer goes here.

6.  **As a statistician, Lily questions the "All others" category. What might be some data and ethical concerns surrounding reporting and aggregating data in this way?**

    Answer goes here.

7.  **Write the null and alternative hypotheses for investigating this research question.**

8.  **How many of the 1,215 people do we expect to see of each ethnic origin if the results of the census are accurate?**

    |                    | Black | Asian | Anglo | Latino/Latina | Indigenous | All others |
    |--------------------|-------|-------|-------|---------------|------------|------------|
    | **Expected Count** |       |       |       |               |            |            |

9.  **Check the conditions for using the Chi-square distribution to test our hypotheses.**

    Answer goes here.

10. **Carry out the Chi-square Goodness of Fit Test and find the p-value for investigating this research question.**

```{r chisq-goodness-of-fit}
chisq_test(x = ________,
           response = _________,
           p = c("________" = ____,
                 "________" = ____,
                 "________" = ____,
                 "________" = ____,
                 "________" = ____,
                 "________" = ____,
           )
  
)
```

11. **From the output, identify the observed test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value.**

12. **Write a conclusion in the context of the research question.**
