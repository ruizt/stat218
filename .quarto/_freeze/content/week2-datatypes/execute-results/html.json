Reading quiz\n2.  Loose ends from last time: LEAP case study; experimental design basics\n3.  Data basics: data semantics and data types\n4.  Lab: data types and data structures in R\n\n## Case study: LEAP\n\nLearning early about peanut allergy (LEAP) study:\n\n-   640 infants in UK with eczema, egg allergy, or both enrolled; 530 passed a skin test showing no peanut allergy\n\n-   each infant randomly assigned to peanut consumption and peanut avoidance groups\n\n    -   peanut consumption: fed 6g peanut protein daily until 5 years old\n\n    -   peanut avoidance: no peanut consumption until 5 years old\n\n-   at 5 years old, oral food challenge (OFC) allergy test administered\n\n    -   PASS: no allergy detected\n\n    -   FAIL: allergy detected\n\nReview questions from last time:\n\n1.  *Experiment or observational study?*\n2.  *Retrospective, prospective, or neither?*\n\n## Case study: LEAP\n\n![](img/leaps-2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"400\"} ![](img/leap-1.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"400\"}\n\nA greater proportion of children in the avoidance group developed an allergy (11.8% specifically). Given the type of study, which is a more accurate interpretation of this result?\n\na.  Compared with consumption, peanut avoidance early in life *was associated with* more frequent occurrence of peanut allergies among children in the study.\n\nb.  Compared with consumption, peanut avoidance early in life *led to* more frequent occurrence of peanut allergies among children in the study.\n\n## Experimental design\n\nThe LEAP study exemplifies the simple kind of design we will consider for much of STAT218:\n\n-   two \"treatments\" (peanut consumption and peanut avoidance)\n-   treatments are allocated completely at random among all study units\n\nThe design of an experiment refers to how treatments (experimental interventions) are allocated to study units.\n\n-   the number of **replicates** of a treatment refers to the number of study units receiving that treatment\n-   a design is **balanced** if all treatments have equal numbers of replicates\n-   treatment allocation should always be randomized; different designs use different randomization schemes\n\n*Check your understanding: is the experimental design of the LEAP study balanced?*\n\n## Data semantics\n\n-   **Data** are a set of measurements.\n\n-   A **variable** is any measured attribute of study units.\n\n-   An **observation** is a measurement of one or more variables taken on one particular study unit.\n\nIt is usually expedient to arrange data values in a table in which each row is an observation and each column is a variable:\n\n![](img/data-matrix.png)\n\n## LEAP example\n\nA table showing the observations and variables for the LEAP study would look like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n-------------------------------------------------------\n participant.ID    treatment.group     ofc.test.result \n---------------- -------------------- -----------------\n  LEAP_100522     Peanut Consumption      PASS OFC     \n\n  LEAP_103358     Peanut Consumption      PASS OFC     \n\n  LEAP_105069      Peanut Avoidance       PASS OFC     \n\n  LEAP_105328     Peanut Consumption      PASS OFC     \n-------------------------------------------------------\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe table you saw earlier was a **summary** of the data (not the data itself):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n----------------------------------------------\n         &nbsp;           FAIL OFC   PASS OFC \n------------------------ ---------- ----------\n  **Peanut Avoidance**       36        227    \n\n **Peanut Consumption**      5         262    \n----------------------------------------------\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Numeric and categorical variables\n\nVariables are classified according to their values. The broadest distinction made is between **numeric** and **categorical** variables.\n\n-   A variable is numeric if its value is a number\n-   A variable is categorical if its value is a category, usually recorded as a name or label\n\nFor example:\n\n-   the value of `sex` can be male or female, so it is categorical\n-   whereas `age` (in years) can be any positive integer, so it is numeric\n\n*Check your understanding: in the LEAP study...*\n\n-   *treatment group is \\[numeric/categorical\\]*\n-   *OFC test result is \\[numeric/categorical\\]*\n\n## Variable subtypes\n\nFurther distinctions are made based on the type of number or type of category used to measure an attribute. *Can you match the subtypes to the variables at right?*\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"0.65\"}\n![](img/variable-types.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"0.35\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n---------------------------------\n age   hispanic   grade   weight \n----- ---------- ------- --------\n 15      not       10     78.02  \n\n 18    hispanic    12     78.47  \n\n 17      not       11     95.26  \n\n 18      not       12     95.26  \n---------------------------------\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n-   a numerical variable is **discrete** if there are 'gaps' between its *possible* values\n-   a numerical variable is **continuous** if there are no such gaps\n-   a categorical variable is **nominal** if its levels are not ordered\n-   a categorical variable is **ordinal** if its levels are ordered\n\n## Many ways to measure attributes\n\nVariable type (or subtype) is not an inherent quality --- attributes can often be measured in many different ways.\n\nFor instance, `age` might be measured as either a discrete, continuous, or ordinal variable, depending on the situation:\n\n| Age (years) | Age (minutes) | Age (brackets) |\n|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| 12          | 6307518.45    | 10-18          |\n| 8           | 4209187.18    | 5-10           |\n| 21          | 11258103.08   | 18-30          |\n\n> Numeric variables can always be represented as categorical, *but not the other way around*.\n\n## Your turn: identifying data types I\n\nClassify each variable as nominal, ordinal, discrete, or continuous:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ndrm.ch   drm.ch    sex     age     race      height   weight   actn3.r577x    bmi  \n--------- -------- -------- ----- ----------- -------- -------- ------------- -------\n  33.3       0      Female   19    Caucasian    65.7     129         CT        21.01 \n\n  71.4       0      Female   18      Other       67      148         CT        23.18 \n\n  37.5       0      Female   21    Caucasian    66.7     183         CC        28.92 \n\n   50        0      Female   28      Asian       61      112         CC        21.16 \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n:::\n:::\n\n\nData are from an observational study investigating demographic, physiological, and genetic characteristics associated with muscle strength.\n\n-   `ndrm.ch` and `drm.ch` are change in strength in nondominant and dominant arms before and after training\n-   `actn3.r577x` gives genotype at a particular location within the ACTN3 gene (so-called \"sports gene\")\n\n## Your turn: identifying data types II\n\nRecall the kimchi/prediabetes study from last time:\n\n> A total of 21 participants with prediabetes were enrolled. During the first 8 weeks, they consumed either fresh (1-day-old) or fermented (10-day-old) kimchi. After a 4-week washout period, they switched to the other type of kimchi for the next 8 weeks. Consumption of both types of kimchi significantly decreased body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Fermented kimchi decreased insulin resistance, and increased insulin sensitivity ... Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly in the fermented kimchi group. The percentages of participants who showed improved glucose tolerance were 9.5 and 33.3% in the fresh and fermented kimchi groups, respectively.\n\n-   list the minimal collection of variables measured\n-   determine a likely type for each variable\n-   invent a few example observations to sketch what the data table might look like\n\n## Describing studies\n\nLet's put some pieces together. The \"essential information\" to report when explaining/presenting a study comprises:\n\n1.  Research question or hypothesis\n2.  Type of study\n3.  Number and type of study units\n4.  If applicable, experimental design\n5.  Observations and variables measured\n\n## Lab: data types and structures in R\n\nThe simplest data structure in R is a **vector**: a collection of values of a single \"type\". This lab will introduce you to data types, vectors, and a few other common data structures.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"0.5\"}\n![](img/data-types.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"0.5\"}\nThe variable types we just discussed map pretty neatly (but not perfectly) onto the main \"data types\" in R:\n\n-   numeric ➜ integer, numeric\n-   categorical ➜ character, logical\n\nYour objectives in this lab are: \n\n1. learn to perform simple calculations\n2. learn to recognize data types and data structures\n:::\n:::\n\n## Up next: descriptive statistics\n\nSo far we've discussed study designs and the basics of data.\n\n**Descriptive statistics** refers to techniques for summarizing data:\n\n- numerical summaries\n- tables\n- graphical summaries\n\nSuch summaries are essential first steps in any data analysis, as they convey what was directly observed in the study.",
