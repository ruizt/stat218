You may refer to all class materials, notes, and textbooks, but **must complete this assignment on your own**. By submitting your work, you are affirming that your work is your own and you have not consulted with anyone else in preparing your answers. Please use the word document provided (download from the class website) and write in your answers below each prompt. You should submit your work via Gradescope; please skip the page matching step and do not match pages to parts of the outline.\n\nThe test comprises two parts: concepts, containing short multiple-choice questions; and applications, which requires some data analysis. Revisions will be allowed for the applications part, but not for the concepts part.\n\n## Part I: concepts\n\nThis part comprises multiple-choice questions about key concepts discussed in class.

The datasets, and commands to import them, are available to you in a project called `test1` in the class posit workspace. You will need to perform calculations to answer the questions, but do not need to provide codes used to perform the calculations with your answers. When in doubt, look to the lab activities for examples.\n\n### Diets and chick weights\n\nThe following data come from a study investigating the early growth of chicks on different diets. In the study, 47 chicks were randomly assigned one of four diets at birth and researchers measured body weight in grams daily. The data below show body weights at 18 days since birth for each chick. The question of interest is: which diet is best?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in data\nchick <- read.csv('data/chick.csv')\n\n# preview\nhead(chick)\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.  \\[L2\\] Is this observational or experimental data? Explain your reasoning.\n2.  \\[L3\\] Produce a visualization that compares body weight distributions by diet. For which diet have chicks grown the most? The least? Explain the statistic(s) or features of the distribution you used to make this determination.\n3.  \\[L3\\] Calculate point estimates and standard errors for the mean body weight at 18 days after birth on each diet.\n4.  \\[L2\\] Assume that in the previous question you found that chicks on diet 3 grew the most, regardless of your actual answer. Can you conclude that diet 3 caused the fastest growth? Explain why or why not.\n5.  \\[L4\\] Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean body weight of chicks on diet 3 at 18 days after birth. Interpret the interval in context.\n\n### GSS data\n\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) is an effort to measure behaviors, opinions, and demographics of Americans and has been conducted annually since 1972. The data below are observations of a small collection of variables for 500 respondents from across several survey years.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# import GSS data\ngss <- read.csv('data/gss.csv')\n\n# preview\nhead(gss)\n```\n:::\n\n\n6.  \\[L3\\] Make a histogram of the weekly hours worked and describe the shape and modality. Choose an appropriate number of breaks.\n7.  \\[L3\\] What is the 20th percentile of weekly hours worked among respondents? What is the 80th percentile?\n8.  \\[L3\\] Compute a point estimate of the mean hours worked. Report the estimate and its standard error.\n9.  \\[L4\\] Produce and interpret an 85% confidence interval for the mean weekly hours worked.\n10. \\[L3\\] Use an appropriate graphical summary to assess whether mean hours worked seems to differ by class. Explain the plot you produce and interpret any patterns observed.\n11. \\[L3\\] Make any additional bivariate comparison addressing a question of your choice. State the question in non-technical terms, produce a visualization that conveys the comparison, and interpret any patterns observed.\n",
